i only watched 3 or so episodes...oh man my boyfriend and i watched it, it was brutal but however since i came across this video i was like "oh i gotta watch this" to get the synopsis and the idea behind this. By far this show is very psychological yet intriguing. One last thing to say is that those guys wearing PlayStation controller symbols on their mask just standing behind or around them kind of creeps me out just saying. I like the squid game series overall by far! :) Great job.
