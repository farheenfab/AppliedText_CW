I think because everyone have this image of seeing anime as so called "cartoons" that's why anime isn't that famous but tbh i really like this small anime community because i believe that everything that get a lot of fame it just become a little bit cringy for example after seeing this series , the korean version of red light, green light used in reels/tiktok/shorts is kinda getting overused and annoyes me a lot so in the end i want this anime community like this forever and enjoy anime series at the fullest
