-gainsanryan3687 They are many that are quite creative/well executed coming out of Korea. It's not a coincidence that Parasite won the oscars last year. Their film industry is quite strong.

For other good creative psych-thriller kdramas on netflix, i highly recommend Kingdom, Sweet Home, Hell is Other People, D.P (Deserter Pursuit). If you watch them you won't say they are not "that creative". Creativity is not only in the content but in the execution as well. Just watch, you won't be disappointed.
