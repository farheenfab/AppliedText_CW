 i didn't watch a lot of kdramas/kmovies tbh, but when i did, i saw the same talent and the same passion and emotions as in Hollywood movies, or even much better as you said. They're too underrated, mostly because Hollywood controls the whole music/movie industries. People just need to be more open minded (especially from where i come from - arab & european world ).
