Squid Game is pretty interesting show and the acting is top-notch. Very colorful characters and back stories. Lots of Easter Eggs throughout, which is always fun. 

I worried how Jimmy Fallon's interview would go being virtual and translating back and forth. I assume it wasn't live and edited to look live, but it always amazes me how technology can help very different people to communicate effectively back and forth.
