Just for anyone wondering, the clips used in this trailer are from a Chinese movie called 'Animal World' . 
Which is basically about a bunch of people who are in huge amounts of debt that go onto a ship to clear their debt by paying 'rock, paper, scissors' but with cards. Absolutely amazing movie, would definitely recommend 10/10 :)
