Shoutout to Jimmy for being such a great host for international idols, actors etc. He doesn't ask mainstream questions and you can tell he does research to get to know the celebrities before they come on the show. I've seen so many interviews with American hosts and they ask questions that can be found literally all over the internet (so if you are a fan of the group, show or individual, you aren't learning anything new about them) or they don't even try to identify the international guests by their names. They just point or gesture to them. It's so refreshing to see Jimmy interact with international guests. We love and appreciate Jimmy <3 #besthostever
