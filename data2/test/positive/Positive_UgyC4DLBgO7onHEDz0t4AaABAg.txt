Love how they all seem so humble and sweet. Loved the show and the characters! I am officially a fan of South Korea. These actors are all so damn talented. And they are all so cute too <3
I ended up watching the show only because that "thumbnail" of the weird creepy doll kept popping up on Netflix (I'm from Denmark) so I was like, what the f**k is this shit, and then it sounded intriguing, but I never expected it to have such a huge impact on me. I was enchanted! And that twist... I seldom get that surprised by twists, but damn! This one totally tricked me and it blew my mind. The best twists are those you never saw coming but in hindsight, you can't believe you never saw it coming. Amazing! Top-notch storytelling and plotting! 5 out of 5 stars from here.
