park hae soo's character in squid game is still a bit underrated in my opinion. well idk if its just me but i dont see much people talking about his acting skills. like he honestly did a great job on portraying cho sangwoo fr. i seriously cant think of any actor who can portray sangwoo as hae soo portrayed it. cos man, i only see people hating on his character because he betrayed ali, but i hope they also get to see his amazing acting skills too. but anyway lol i suggest for yall to watch his other dramas like prison playbook.
