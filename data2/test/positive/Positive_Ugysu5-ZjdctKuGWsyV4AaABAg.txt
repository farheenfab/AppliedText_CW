Man, as an avid watcher of Korean dramas and Korean movies for years, seeing all Korean content get more and more fans lately and seeing increasingly more Korean shows being talked about and available on huge streaming platforms like Netflix just makes me so so happy. Before I couldn't talk to anyone about my kdramas, it was just my own little world but now I have whole conversations with friends about some of them and it honestly just blows my mind. I hope people start appreciating kdramas more and more because it's honestly so worth it, trust me...!
This cast did a great job, I absolutely loved Squid Game, and seeing my beloved actors on American TV Shows makes me really proud <3
