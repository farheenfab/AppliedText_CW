 Don't know what you're so pissy about but every other movie, show, or series that you want to mention to argue against Squid Game, they're great but combine them all into Squid Game. So yeah the show deserves the praise. And it's refreshing because it's not the typical dark gore horror, it is literally using children's games. The sets and tone are colorful and fun. Despite having tropes, it's also unique.
