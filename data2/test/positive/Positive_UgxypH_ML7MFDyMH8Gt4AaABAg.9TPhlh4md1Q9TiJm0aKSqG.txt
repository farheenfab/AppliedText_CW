How people didn't give enough, there is tons of comments of it just here. It's clear from the Escheresque staircase hallway to the red suits and all of the masks that the show is very well done in creating a cohesive world while still looking stylized and unique. I'm pretty sure the look of the show is one of the first things that come to peoples minds, art directors aren't almost never in these kinda panel type interviews so people must have shown apprecitiation for her being there.
