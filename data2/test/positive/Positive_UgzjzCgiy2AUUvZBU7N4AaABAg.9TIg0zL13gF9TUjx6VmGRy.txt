wow i agree so much... even my friend whose afraid a little amount of blood like nosebleed is able to watch this series completely bcs she'll get curious over this series... although sometimes she closes her eyes haha..  i assume bcs we watch it together, and on the other side it gives you the vibes like the relatable slice of life and awesome feelings while suspense and gore in the same time
