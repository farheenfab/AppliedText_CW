I've been a fan of Asian cinema for a while. They make excellent film art.

There were many life lessons in this movie, and some appear to be playing out right now.

The acting is magnificent.
The writing delves into the characters to make them human.
The set design.  
The costume designs. 

The polarization of human beings depicted in this film is accurate. Zero judgment. They all did what they thought was best at that moment.

The movie also showed how having tunnel vision in life could sometimes ruin your life. Everyone focused solely on winning that money to make their lives better. They forgot about living. 

And not one person questioned anything in regards to the money or the games. They followed along like zombies.

Netflix, please don't wait until 2054 to do season 2
