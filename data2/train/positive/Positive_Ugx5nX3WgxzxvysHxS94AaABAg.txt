even though this seems like a really stupid matchup it was amazingly executed 

I especially love the editing here on Gi-hun's first turn 

Also love how Mr.Beasts way of rapping is way more In your face, well simply because Jimmy is really loud and in your face when it comes to his videos so it fits his charcater!
