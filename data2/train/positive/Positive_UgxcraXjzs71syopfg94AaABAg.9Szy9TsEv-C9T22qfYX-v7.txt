For me the soundtrack and overall audio in series (and games) is extremely important so I payed close attention to Squid game´s music. It was really something special, it created a atmosphere I don ´t remember anywhere else. it was like this creepy but also gentle and nice feeling. Very strange series, but I loved every minute.
