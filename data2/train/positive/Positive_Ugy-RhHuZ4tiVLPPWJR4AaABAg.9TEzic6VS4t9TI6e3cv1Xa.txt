 ikr? This series has a really biiig problem with logic. VIPs... bro ngl I skipped the whole scenes where they were involved. This is some another lvl of cringe I cant even explain. 
And tbh the acting of some actors is just eh. For example the main girl in this series played the whole show with LITERALLY the same face. Ok? I know she's model in NYC but why would you keep that relaxed b1tch face the whole series? And so on. 
Its a good show dont get me wrong, great camera man work and art directing, but its definitely not the best show.
