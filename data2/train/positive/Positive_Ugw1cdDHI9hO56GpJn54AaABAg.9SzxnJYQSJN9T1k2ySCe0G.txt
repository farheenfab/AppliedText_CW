 the old man isnt as evil as you think but im not saying he isnt evil, the old man said that he didnt decide who gets to play at the games, the people did decide to play it for the money but he obviously knows that a money that large will bait people with large debts plus he also gave them a second chance if they wanna quit or they wanna continue the game
