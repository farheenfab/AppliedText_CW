I wasn't sure exactly what, but I knew something was way off when he was "shot" off-camera.  Everyone else of significance either dies on-camera or their body is shown.  I wasn't all that surprised to see him at the end.  Still better than the plot twist with the cop's brother though-I saw that one coming a mile away.

Good show though; I just think it needed more blood.  It's an entertaining concept but it wasn't violent enough.
