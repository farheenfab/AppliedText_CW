 to be fair I believe they just handed them marbles and said play whatever you want.
Most people we saw opted for odd vs even- you say whether you think they have an odd number of marbles in their hand or an even number, and you put marbles in your own hand as a bet. So if you guess right, you get however many marbles you were holding. So in theory a person could put all 10 marbles in their hand as a wager, and play only one round. It could be anything- marbles rocks sweeties which is what threw me because I was like ?how is this a marble game. Does that help :)
