Squid Game's production budget was about $20M...a fraction of most other Netflix shows and Hollywood movies. But for Korea, $20M is a big budget and you can bet that Netflix will pour more money into Korean content in the future and you will see more edgy content from Korea. Win, win, win....a win for the global audience, a win for Korean actors & directors (...their contract value will skyrocket), and a win for Netflix.
