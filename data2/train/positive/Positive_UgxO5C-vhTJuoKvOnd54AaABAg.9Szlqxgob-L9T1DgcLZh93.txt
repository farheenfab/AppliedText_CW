Whoever is hating on this show is a hater in real life. I don’t watch a lot of tv because most of it is pointless and hard to engage in. But this show is truly a masterpiece, one of a kind. That’s why the director is so exhausted to the point where he can’t even think about making a second season right now because of how much hard and intelligent work they put in the first. Just think about it, what show has been a universal hit like this even with translation.
