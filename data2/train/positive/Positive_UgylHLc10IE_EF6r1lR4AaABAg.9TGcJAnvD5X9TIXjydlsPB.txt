 I didn't say my taste has anything to do with yours. I just find it hard to believe and am considering that maybe those who elevate this show, has a Korean fascination, have not seen much, or just think the last good show they've seen is the best. Was hoping you'd give more information on what you enjoy so I could figure it out.

About my daughter watching the show - it's pretty tame violence, and my approach parenting is non conservative. Definitely don't want to coddle my children till their teens when they'll suddenly have uncontrolled influences.
