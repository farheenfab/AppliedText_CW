-Chicken the Kaiji anime was released in 2007. So yeah makes sense it took around 10 years to think about copying Kaiji and make Squid Game. Yeah they play the Korean Squid game and the end of the series. But, the other games that the characters have to play are just variations of the games they play in the first season on Kaiji. Only the Squid Game is completely different. But the whole premise of the plot is the same and Kaiji is more interesting and just better than Squid Game.
