â€‹@eric You're a little s1ick puppy, aren't you? I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be so happy to expose your fellow man to such horrendous garbage if your family members or loved ones were to be unlawfully or wrongly imprisoned. Not to mention there are so many people jailed in this world simply for being the "wrong" skin color or race (there's a huge mafia industry that feeds of high numbers of inmates in order to receive greater government funding). But judging by your s1ick psych3e, you don't really have many loved ones, do you? Not to mention that concepts like "learning your lesson", or "changing yourself", or "becoming a better person" appear completely foreign to your cruel and tyra nny loving w3eak mind.
