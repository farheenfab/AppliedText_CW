 it is extremely gory. However its counterbalanced with a softer set and costume design. The characters are both likeable and and dislike able at the same time. Other then the first 15 minutes or so of the first episode the series is amazing.  It does an amazing job working the violence into the plot so its easier to keep watching. Even though it would be a terrible situation it really makes you think about how easy you could end up in that jam if it played out in real life. I highly recommend at least watching the first episode.
