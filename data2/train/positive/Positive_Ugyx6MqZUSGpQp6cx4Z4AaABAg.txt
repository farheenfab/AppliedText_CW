I love it how Sang Woo's actor doesn't talk much. I like introverts because I'm one. Not that I don't like extroverts, just that I find the quieter ones more relatable. I love how Gi-hun's actor improvised and brought a lot of heart into the show.
I love it how the art director said she could make another show with the rejected ideas. I could sense they worked really hard on this, now it's confirmed that's why Squid Game is so beautiful. I really appreciated all the effort put into the show by everyone, I love a work where a lot of care is put, something built with a lot of love and care.
I really enjoyed every bit of the talk.
