Also, Ilnam gave Gihun his 001 jacket saying something like "they'll look down on you without this". At the time we thought he meant the players but he really meant the guards. The guards were most likely instructed NOT to kill anyone wearing 001, as it was Ilnam's number.

Also, I think Ilnam was humbled by the experience even if he did create it. He told the frontman something like "playing is different than watching" and decided not to watch with the VIPs. I think he began to feel guilty for being entertained by it all after getting to know Gihun and how the players are real people who took care of him, not just scum on the streets, even though it's evident he still has a bit of prejudice towards them evident in how he talked about the homeless man in the last episode.
