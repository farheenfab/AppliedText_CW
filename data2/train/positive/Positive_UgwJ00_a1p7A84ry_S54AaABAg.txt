We live in an amazing time. There is so much incredible talent out there. And thanks to the internet and Streaming services we can get to enjoy all these stories and witness all the incredible talent that's out there in spite of the separation created by physical distance, and cultural and language barriers. Every actor in the Squid Game really produced a great performance. And the story, itself works on so many different levels. Congratulations to all involved in its creation and production. Cheers from The Land Down Under!
