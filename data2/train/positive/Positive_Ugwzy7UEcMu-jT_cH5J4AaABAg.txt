I came to say, WE DEFINITELY NEED A SEASON 2 [SPOILER ALERT BELOW]

If there will be a season 2, these are my guesses. The last part in s1 showed that Gi hun is tempted to join the game again. My guess is that while he’s in the facility, he’ll begin his own investigation of how everything works up to who is the mastermind and why he does this, or how they have so many money. I’m thinking he doesn’t want alliance with anyone but someone or some people will be with him too. I hope he makes friends with one of the circle, triangle, or square guards too and make him spill some secrets. And why do I think the cop is still alive? I think the cliff he’s fallen off must’ve not been that high or that he must’ve landed in the water- or even maybe he fell onto a bush. I don’t know- I’m just exciteddddd aaa

At the same time, I’m thinking there won’t be a season 2 since almost everything gets somehow explained in season 1. I hope there will be S2 still.
