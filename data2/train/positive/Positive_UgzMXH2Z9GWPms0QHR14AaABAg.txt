Jung Ho-yeon saying she was worried about her acting astounded me because to me her acting was honestly so amazing. I found myself crying so so hard over hers and Lee Yoo-mi's acting and their last scenes were so well done. I absolutely loved Squid Games and the characters that were played in it! I hope if they ever make another season, we get to see more of everyone (whether it be in flashbacks or something)!
