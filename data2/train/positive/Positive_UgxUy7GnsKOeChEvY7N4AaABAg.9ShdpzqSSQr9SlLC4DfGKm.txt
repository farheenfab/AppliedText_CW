-oz4bd ahh okay okay
Don't worry I'm 20+ and also it might sound weird but i like movies and dramas with such concepts
It's triggering definitely for alot of people (not for me) but such concepts are pretty interesting
And if that's the case I'd definitely watch it
Btw how many parts does this movies has???
