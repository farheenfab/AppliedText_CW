 it's not an opinion. I said some of them were great actors. But some of them over exaggerate and are to dramatic. And I guarantee I've seen more Korean movies than any of you by far. As I said I've been watching Korean movies since Jacki chan back in the early 90's. 

It's annoying how you all come in here and act like these are great actors and this is something new. No! There have been much better Korean actors/actresses than this cast for years and years. Stop hyping up Kdrama like it's some new thing. It's simply just another tv show. And it was pretty damn good with some really good and meg acting. Period.
