Sae-byeok may be my favourite character because she is so charming. But actually Sang-woo is the most interesting and realistic character. Coming to think of it, that actor  (Park Hae Soo) did an outstanding job too. Great job to the team and the director, for writing the story, pick the perfect cast, and making it such a phenomenal series.
