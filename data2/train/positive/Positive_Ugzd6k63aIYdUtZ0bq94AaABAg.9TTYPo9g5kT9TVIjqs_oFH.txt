As a person that has been a lot in Korea and with many Korean friends I'm also really happy directors and actors gets recognition. Parasite was a masterpiece and I knew the would get some Oscars that night. I screamed like crazy when they won the Oscar for best picture because it was deserving it. Park Chan-Wooks The Handmaiden is one of my all time favourite films.
