I feel like squidgame went so fast but didn’t go to the roast that Mr. Beast went to. Mr. Beast seemed like he wanted to try and go to the point where it wasn’t too far but it was definitely on the line. Where squidgame just went really fast and roast him with some pretty average roast. Anyone agree?
