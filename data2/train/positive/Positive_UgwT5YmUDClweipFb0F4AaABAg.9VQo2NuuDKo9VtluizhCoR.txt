 This is still my opinion, but the live-action ones have lines that hit or miss, but in the animated ones they always SLAUGHTER eachother. Like in Kirby vs. The Very Hungry Caterpillar. The writing here is great, but it feels like the animated ones have AMAZING writing. Those ones, I'll say are on the tier of ERB. But hey, that's just an opinion.
