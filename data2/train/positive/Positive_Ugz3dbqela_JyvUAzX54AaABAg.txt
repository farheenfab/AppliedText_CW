It was a good show. I enjoyed it.
However if i want to get picky. I think they could have done some more takes on the scenes involving the VIPs.
There's just something about the acting that seems a bit off. Like i said, maybe that's just me being picky.
But it just seems like they could have practiced those scenes a little better.
