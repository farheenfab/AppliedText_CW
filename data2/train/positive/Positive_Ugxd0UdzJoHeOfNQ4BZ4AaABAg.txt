I'm going to be honest, I didn't have high expectations for this series but seeing that everyone spoke wonders of it and even recommended it, I dared to watch it; And believe me it was the best thing I did, I literally watched the entire series in just ONE DAY; I am not one of those who like to watch series because they tend to bore me but it did not happen in this case, its plot, suspense totally enveloped me. I dare say that it is the best series Netflix has ever released. Let's hope the second season of "Squid Game" comes out.
