This was such an amazing show! I loved every bit of it. It was so gripping, so emotional, and very well executed! I can't wait for a second season. He didn't get on the plane and acted as if he was looking for revenge. I loved the marble game the most. As soon as they said they were to be in teams of 2, I knew they were going to play against each other where one in each pair would be eliminated. They of course thought to pair up with their friend and be teammates. Everything about the show was playing on all the different social dynamics within human interactions, and it was done perfectly!
