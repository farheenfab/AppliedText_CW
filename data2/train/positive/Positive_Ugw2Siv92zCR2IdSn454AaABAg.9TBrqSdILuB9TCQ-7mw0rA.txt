 Really impressed with how they were able to cast A class actors like Lee Jungjae, Lee Byunghun and Kim Youngok aswell as the cameo of Gong Yoo. I realized LJJ's patterns in working on a drama project; they are all amazing. He's very smart in choosing his projects and I love how he portrays his characters really well.
