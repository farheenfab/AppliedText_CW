CONGRATS TO AESPA!!  SM, YOU BETTER LET AESPA SING LIVE WITH THEIR NEW REMIXES SONGS WITH A LIVE BAND VERSION (IF NOT A BAND JUST REMIX THE SONGS). AND YALL BETTER NOT LET THE BACKTRACK VOCALS OVERSHADOW THEM. PLEASE, YALL BETTER GIVE THEM ENGAGING CHOREOGRAPHIES SO THEY WONT LOOK ROBOTIC. YOU DONT NEED TO CHANGE ENTIRE MOVES JUST THE WAY IT WOULD BE REPRESENTED IN A WIDE WIDE STAGE. THE CHOREO SHOULD ALSO BE APPROPRIATE WITH THEIR SINGING SO IT WONT BE TOO HARD FOR THEM TO SING FREELY. WITH A FIRE OUTFITS THAT WOULD GIVE THEIR PERSONALITIES JJUSTIC. TRAIN THE GIRLS TO HAVE BETTER STAGE PRESENCE. ILL REALLY BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SINCE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME AESPA WILL HAVE ITS FIRST PERFORMANCE EVER. PLEASE GIVE THEM A FIRE PERFORMANCE THAT SOULD SHAKE THE INDUSTRY. YOU ARE LITERALLY ONE OF THE BIG 3 COMPANIES AND WE BETTER HAVE SOMETHING TO SEE FROM THIS GROUP. BP COACHELLA WAS NICE AND IF YALL GIVE HALF EFFORT TO THIS GIRL. THEN GOODLUCK OF THEM BEING CALLED A FLOP AGAIN. FANS WANT THE BEST FOR AESPA. PLEASE JUST PLEASE LET AESPA RULE AND EAT THE STAGE IN COACHELLA.
