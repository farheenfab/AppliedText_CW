 I am not a Korean (Iâ€™m Chinese), but i do feel the same. I feel like Western shows normally gain more traction. Squid Game definitely deserves the rank just because of the popularity it has garnered. I barely see Chinese dramas or pop, or Japanese dramas or pop, or Korean etc etc. So it has really surprised me that Squid Game got so popular..
