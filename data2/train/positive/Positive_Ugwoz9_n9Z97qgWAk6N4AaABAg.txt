The stray cat scene is actually incredibly effective to Gihun's personality and his relationship with money. He wastes money and goods at gambling. He has to beg people for money. You hate him for  it. But when he does get a bit of money or something precious he flaunts it a bit or gives it away (i.e. the cat, the money tender girl) it gives him a sense that he wants to be a good and helpful person. And the best way he can think of is using money he doesn't even have.
