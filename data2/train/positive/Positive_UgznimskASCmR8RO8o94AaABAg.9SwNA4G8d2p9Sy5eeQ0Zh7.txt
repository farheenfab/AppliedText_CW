i watch kdramas but usually romance ones so im scared to watch this one, should I? this seems very violent which is why im unsure. I dont know i really dislike horror genre so it seems interesting but like i also dont like too much gore but some is ok for me so do you think this is an okay show to watch for someone who doesnt like horror? i just really want someone elses input ive seen it all over my fyp and tiktok and i dont quite understand except ppl saying "if u dont like gore dont watch it" except i have certain levels of not liking it so thats why i want to know LOL
