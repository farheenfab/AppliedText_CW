I got it figured out when the camera doesn't show his death... Would be a very emotional scene and every director would have wanted it to bring more impact to the episode... It was way weird... Didn't figured out exactly he was the master behind it all, but knew for sure he was someone special to the organization and they wouldn't let him die
