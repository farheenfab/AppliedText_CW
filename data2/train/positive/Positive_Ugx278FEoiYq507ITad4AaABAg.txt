one thing about this cast is they’re all so humble and polite. they compliment eachother so well and also are so kind to their directors, supporting cast. an honest testimonial to a culture that’s been unrepresented in big media for a while. I look forward to seeing a lot Korean movies/shows because of Squid Game :)
