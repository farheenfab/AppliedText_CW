Really, I'm surprised. Me and my 11yr old daughter liked it. Having watched movies and series from the 80's to date though, I'd find 100's better shows. Just from similarly gritty Korean movies, Old boy and Sympathy for Mr vengeance are better. There are plenty better sci fi, comedy, and drama series though.
