I’m seriously so in love with the cast, with the Korean language and culture, their beautiful names...the show in general and the anti-capitalist theme behind it.. the acting of these talented humans. Everything is just absolutely amazing. I’m a huge fan  so happy for the director and these incredible human beings. I wish Deok-su, Han Mi-nyeo and Ali were here too:(
