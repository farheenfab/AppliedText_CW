These sorts of games have been going on for a long time. Homeless individuals disappear all the time. Human trafficking isn't just for work or sex or ritual. 

It is a distraction to keep us in basal emotions. This show will show our consent from it's viewership and the attention modern humans give it. 

In plain sight.

The elite don't want to and potentially won't need to be so underground with how they like to get off anymore.

I bet the show is riveting and really pulls at ones emotions in ways the intrigue, inspire and entertain many.

Like most modern programming. I'll be sitting this one out.

...or maybe one day I will binge watch it. But for now it doesn't look like something I'll walk away from feeling better from than before I took it into my consciousness.
