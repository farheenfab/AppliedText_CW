yes so true, actually her dance was unique and very detailed, unlike karina who has energy and stamina and makes the choreography as easy and light, giselle has the fance style where she has swag, and strong movement, she also in charge in harmonious in dancing despite having to stand behind and do different hands movement. 
      thats why i said that giselle dance is very unique, she has quite difficult choreography in savage.i hope that giselle will showcase more her talent in rapping, dancing and singing high notes.
