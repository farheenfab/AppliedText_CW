 Truly believe Jaeil jung deserves more for ages. He does many works not only soundtracks for entertainment. He can play number of instruments and compose beautiful harmony with both Korean and Western instruments. Again he is a self taught musician. Jaeil has his own Youtube channel. Hope you check out more on his channel “Jung Jaeil” (FYI, Korean put down family name first). Also recommend you to check a song called ‘Wild Flower’. He composed it and plays the piano in the official mv.
