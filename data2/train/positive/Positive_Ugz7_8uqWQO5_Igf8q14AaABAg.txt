Happy to see more kdrama/movie/show get recognition. They are truly amazing. Full of famous stars!!! Jung Jae, Lee Byung Hun, GongYoo etc. Jung Jae is a legend! When Jimmy said he played all evil characters I was quite surprised, He started out as a heartthrob in the 90's and with all nice characters. This role us def diff than his previous roles. He also lives a very quite life.  to the director/writer/creator he truly a genius for writing this 10 yrs ago. I wish he was at the interview. This whole show they able to pack suspend, emotion, full of lessons. So happy I binge while working yesterday
