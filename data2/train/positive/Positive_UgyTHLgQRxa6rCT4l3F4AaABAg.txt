How often I've said 3 hour films are just a bit too long, but all 9 in one sitting went so fast. Wow. I hope more in Sag union and others really look at these actors, what they formed right away, and with talent and casting management, put together this wonderful cast, international cast, and all those other films, and it's incredible, WAY LESS COST THAN IATSE and Hollywood films, and just incredible production and direction to all else, with marketing and etc. I always point it out as what more and more should do, and more of what I enjoy watching solely.
