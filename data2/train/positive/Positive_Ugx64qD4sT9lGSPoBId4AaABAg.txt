This was a fantastic K-drama. Every actor/actress, director, writers, art designer, and support crew did a fantastic job at the height of their skill set to pull this off. The writing and acting is so much better than a CGI action or gory horror show. This show truly kept me in suspense to the end. A rare feat in todayâ€™s entertainment. Job well done!
