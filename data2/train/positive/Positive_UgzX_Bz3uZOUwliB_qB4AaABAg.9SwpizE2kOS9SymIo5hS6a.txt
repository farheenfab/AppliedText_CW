I watched It’s Okay to Not Be Okay as my second kdrama and its really good. The psychology part of it is really interesting to see since a lot of the show is set in a mental hospital and you see the different types of patients and their diagnosis’s. The characters are also very dynamic and interesting as well as their relationship.
