A lot of beginner and "not so" established actors want to hang out on set to learn more of the craft and to ingratiate themselves with the crew and cast.  The filming industry likes to work with people they know and like.  Also it's great fun.  As long as you don't get in the way, it's a wild experience.  Every day it's something new and for the most part people are having a great time, well expect the "clean up" crew.  Having to reset or clean up after a messy scene is no fun XD
