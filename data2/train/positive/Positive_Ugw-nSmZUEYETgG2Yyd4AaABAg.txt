I know everyone's here for that starting verse meme but I'm here to talk bout the rap battle. Honestly, it's kinda hard to pick a winner...really close and some hard disses and flow from both sides. actually 3 sides. I'm also not very well-versed with the Squid Game stuff...and so for now I say Gi-Hun won just for that unbelievably good 1st verse. "You're like "I spent at least 10,000 dollars renting people out to pretend to be friends with me" straight fire
