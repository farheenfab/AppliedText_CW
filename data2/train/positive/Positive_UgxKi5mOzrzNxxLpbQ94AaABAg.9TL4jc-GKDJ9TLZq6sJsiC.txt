I think it has to do with breaking into Western/English speaking cultures. Shows have become this huge before, but for a Korean show to do so is impressive af and almost unheard of. Similar thing happened with Parasite! I feel like the appreciation they show comes from the fact that they are thankful that people are this interested around the world in a fully Korean show.
