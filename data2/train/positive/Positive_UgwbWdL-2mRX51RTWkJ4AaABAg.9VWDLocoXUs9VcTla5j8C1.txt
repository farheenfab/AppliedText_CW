 I wouldn’t say through and through… at the beginning most definitely I agree a gambling father who can’t afford a nice meal for his daughter sucks, but I feel he isn’t finished redeeming himself for her, which I believe has developed throughout the first season. People can change and maybe he felt he couldn’t go on that plane because although he’s rich he now needs to learn how to be a good father by putting others needs before his own.
