The past few days I was saying to myself how sae Byeoks character was my favorite female character and my second favorite character in any show that wasn’t a cartoon. Her acting was amazing, the character development shown was probably the best I’ve seen. I watch this video and I find it hilarious that the actor playing that character was saying she was getting very upset and very nervous because she didn’t think her acting was good enough.
