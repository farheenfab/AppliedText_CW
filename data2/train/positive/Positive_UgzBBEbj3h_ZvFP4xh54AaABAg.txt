I feel like this was so good, I binge watched the entire thing for 9 hours straight haha, that it's impossible for season 2 to be better or anywhere close to this. Everything was new and original I can't see how they can make a similar show but very different at the same time. I am eagerly anticipating it but just don't see how it can compare because the first season was so good and original and with all the twists and turns
