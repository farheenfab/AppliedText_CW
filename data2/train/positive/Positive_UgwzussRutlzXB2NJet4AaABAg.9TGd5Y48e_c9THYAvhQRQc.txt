I watched this because my tiktok fyp was filled with squid game and I just was tired of it and just watch the show to just understand the memes and stuff I didnt expect it to be that good but when I actually watched I was so amazed and after watched the behind the scenes I was even more amazed I mean it was a phenomenon of a series tbh I loved it all the hard work and all the sweat it counted very single second of it for the actors,directors and staff it was like searching for dirt and finding diamonds it was so good in every way every single second was worth to watch. Also I like how the police officer was literally playing among us in real life
