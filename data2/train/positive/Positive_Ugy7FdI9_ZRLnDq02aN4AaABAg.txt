Ok so about the honeycomb game,

The old man doesn’t select the star, he lets 456 select for him essentially. So I feel like him “selecting an easy shape” is a bit of a moot point. However, that scene still has a bit of an “Easter egg” so to speak. As the old man states at the end, he feels lime there is no kindness left in humanity. 456, however, consistently showed kindness to everyone around him, especially the old man. The old man seemed to want to see 456 to win. You can even see that, when Gi-Hun selects the umbrella, the old man is disappointed, as he thinks one of the only truly kind players was about to get killed.
