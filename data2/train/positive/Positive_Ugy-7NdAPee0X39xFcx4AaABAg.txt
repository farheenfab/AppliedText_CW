i kinda like that they focused more on their own style than synchronization, it highlights their own little charms. To me, somehow, it doesn't look messy, most likely because they only have 4 members, I think that's the perfect amount of members if you're trying to do this type of choreo, if it were anymore than that, I think it would definitely look way messier
