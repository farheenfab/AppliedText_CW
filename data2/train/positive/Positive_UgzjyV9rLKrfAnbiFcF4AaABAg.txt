Even the cast and director talked about Gi hun cheating Il Nam at marbles but when I watched the show, what I saw was Gi Hun trying to play the game by the normal rules but Il Nam was playing by his own, and once Gi Hun understood what Il Nam wanted he started winning. There wasn't any deception, Il Nam got what he wished for!
