I’m in love with the art director. She seems so fun and most importantly, I am so amazed by her intelligence and artistic abilities. It’s not easy to think about creative visuals and these ideas don’t appear out of no where. You have to have innate passion for what you’re doing to project and show what you want. 

Change my mind that Squid Game would really not be big as it is now if it wasn’t for its eerie unique props and visuals. Kudos
