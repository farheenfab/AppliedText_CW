I'm never a fan of violent drama/movie but I watched this because of an interview of Oh Yeong Su (Oh Il Nam) the old man, in Yoo Jae Seok's show How Do You Play. I like his character (aside from the end) along with Ali & Sae Byeok. The acting is definitely top tier and the story is good though i would appreciate a little bit more of a background story. (Maybe they'll do that in season 2 who knows.) Another thing i loved is the accent being used. I'm not sure which accent but i find Gi-Hun's mom, Sae Byeok's brother (NK accent?) and Il Nam's accent is very interesting.
