 alright let me explain it to you since you insist on starting an argument everywhere you go :) 
yes, I know that this person edited the video and I am in no way coming for/insulting the creator of this video. I’m saying it looks real at first and I was joking saying to give a moment of silence for the people who thought the video was hand drawn as in, they didn’t see it was edited at first. Please let me know if you need further clarifications <3
