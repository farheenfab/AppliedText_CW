 Dong=murder-mystery like game Clue. Squid=survival show with social commentary.  Dong requires group death so one individual lives. Squid combines elimination rounds with team projects to critique  behemoth  capitalism + class hierarchy. Dong presents stereotypes with limited character development consistent with animation genre. Squid presents multidimensional human characters in political dark comedy. They're categorically very different.
