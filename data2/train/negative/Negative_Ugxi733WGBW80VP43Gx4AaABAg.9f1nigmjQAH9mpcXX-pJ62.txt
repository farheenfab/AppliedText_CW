same, i've been putting it off for over a year. finally i watch and finished it just a couple of days ago and ended up liking it. i thought it was just one of those overrated overhyped shows specially since it's netflix who produced it and the whole freaking streaming site is saturated with countless kdrama that was also produced by them.
