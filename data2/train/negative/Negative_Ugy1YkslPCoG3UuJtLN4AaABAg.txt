Only thing I would interprete otherwise is the girl crouching in "Red Light Green Light". I believe the machine identifies the participants by their number. Il-Nam obviously is 001, so this number is excluded. The crouching girl next to him does not have her number visible due to her pose. But I base that solely on my observation in this video, I have only seen the scene once, so my point might be invalidated by crouching contestents getting shot that I do not remember.
