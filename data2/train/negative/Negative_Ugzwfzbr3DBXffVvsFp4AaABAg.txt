It's refreshing to see unknown actors in the movie. Hollywood stars are so familiar I couldn't see them as actors anymore.
Scarlett Johansson - hello, Scarlet, I like you but don't care about your stage names, you're Scarlett for me.
Dwayne Johnson - don't remember any single stage name of his roles. He's always Rock.
Keanu Reeves - forever is Neo whatever movie his in.
Unknown actors help to immerse into movie universe and forget about reality.
