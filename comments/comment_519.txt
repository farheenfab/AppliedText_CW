This movie just shows you that you don't need the darkness to create a good horror (edit: psychological thriller) movie.
edit:- I know there's a lot of people who dislike this movie and that's totally fine, this is purely my opinion and what blew me away was the sophisticated symbolism, use of colour and Pugh's acting.
