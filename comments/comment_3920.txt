Watching this again tonight... something i never noticed before: in the first few minutes of the movie, the men are at a restaurant talking about how Christian should be single. One of them comments that he could be getting the waitress pregnant right now and Pele responds " you could be getting a Sweedish girl pregnant " a little bit of innocent foreshadowing
