It’s so easy to hate Mark and Christian, or even Dani at the end, but I think it’s genuinely made that way so you don’t pay attention to good guy Pelle in the back; from the very beginning Pelle has been nice, he’s been understanding and attentive (This is actually something called love bombing which is a method cultists have to overwhelm their victims with empathy and compassion. )

And at the end, Pelle finally gets rid of his “friends” as he knew he would, even though no one of them deserved their fates because he kept them all in the dark and exploited all their weak points and he (presumably) gets the girl in the end, when she’s so drugged out of her mind and overwhelmed that she has no idea what’s going on anymore. 

Pelle does not get the recognition he deserves as a villain.
