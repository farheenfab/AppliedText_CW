Another thing I noticed, in the directors cut, on the road trip to the Harga, there's a cut scene of everyone talking in the car, however, whenever Christian, Josh, Pelle, and Mark speak, the camera always finds a way to cover up Dani,  by hiding her behind a car seat or another person. I believe that this is to represent that she is the shut out and outcast of the group.
