The scary thing is when you realise how vulnerable and easily manipulated you are. I felt myself sympathising with the sect sometimes, I felt myself feeling happy for Dani for finding a community, I felt myself jealous over the “solidarity” they had in Hårga, and this is exactly how cults recruit people. I’d be gone in a second of this was real.
