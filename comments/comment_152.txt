The way he saw her little gesture of picking flowers out of a field for him randomly as her making this huge statement of love and "trapping" him is such a tiny detail but it is so real and relatable, the way dani quietly goes "what flowers??" because it was such a small gesture of love in her eyes that she didn't even remember it, it was just second nature for her, while he dwelled on it all day and resented her for it because it made him look at himself and how badly he'd been treating her but instead of apologizing he figured out a way to pin it all on her, like a true narcissists, I wish they would've kept this scene in, it really shows Christians true colors just a little more and shows that their issues with each other were much deeper than him just forgetting her birthday or planing a trip to another country without telling her first or even Danis family passing away, Christian was most likely always emotionally abusive and neglected Dani smh
