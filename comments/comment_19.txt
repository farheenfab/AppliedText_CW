Florence Pugh didn't get enough credit for her ability to emote in this film. She is great at portraying someone trying to conceal her depression as well as stand up for herself in the face of an uncaring partner, trying to find a balancing act between doing that and not pushing him away. There is a lot of depth to the characters in this film that I don't see in many films.
