i just came up with a theory: With the dance sequence, what if the women around Dani were deliberately falling to make her the last woman standing? They knew she was in pain, and what's the best way to cheer someone up? Make them feel like a princess. They took advantage of her pain and this was only another manner of inducting Dani into the cult. 

This movie is so brilliant. It's not just mindless entertainment, it's a movie that really makes you think and theorize and exposes you to uncomfortable imagery and topics that are very real.
