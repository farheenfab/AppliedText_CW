I'm glad you highlight the rape scene for what it is.  I've watched a lot of videos saying we should be happy about what happens to Christian, because he's an asshole.  Even the CinemaSins video says it, and CinemaSins is far too popular to not be called out on that gross shit.  Saying a man deserves to be raped for being an asshole isn't different than saying a woman deserves it for flirting or dressing sexy.  It's disturbing that that mentality is still out there.
