This is a really interesting scene. You can see how early on the cult is attempting to manipulate Dani. They show her their willingness to listen to her and stop the ritual. And then you have that responsiveness juxtaposed with Christian's unwillingness to leave when she becomes afraid. You can understand how Dani feels supported by the cult and dismissed by Christian.
