Finally a scary movie in the daylight
Update: I have watched the movie and honestly was kind of dissapointed, I though it was gonna be more eerie. And for those comments undermine that are saying that I dont know what Im talking about and so hear me out, what I meant is finally a horror movie that is on the daylight and was meant to have a happy atmosphere. Those that I watch mostly are really dark and already have something eerie either about the place or the characters. This movie was about a celebration gone wrong, cool but not what I was hoping for
