Love this scene because it also gives context how Conny dies, we know she died and we see her dead body at the end with the weight and fir branches and when you see her you clearly see she was drowned because of her skin but this scene gives away that its a tradition too. 

On the relationship side it makes the rift bigger between Danny and Christian, Danny at this point is still sceptical because of the cliff ritual and Christian doesnt want and cant read the room to back off, it gives the last "smile scene" more impact. 
Such a good movie.
