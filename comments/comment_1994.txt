the fact that this guy interprets the movie's ending as positive is absolutely mind blowing to me. that's the genius thing about it though, it makes you empathise with her and you don't even realise that this is the most horrific ending possible - her mind is broken and she is literally consumed by their ritual, symbolised in her dress. It's the end of the journey for her - she's been completely indoctrinated, and so has the audience.
