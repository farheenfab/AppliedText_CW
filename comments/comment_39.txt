Fun fact: The moving flower on Dani’s flower crown actually corresponds to her heartbeat. You can see it at a relatively faster than normal pace when it’s placed on her, super fast when she’s kissed by Pelle, and slow and steady afterwards as she’s calmly participating in the rituals. It’s a small detail inside of an already small detail, and I absolutely love it.
