Someone else said this scene adds too much specificity to their relationship, and I 100% agree. Additionally, I think it adds too much specificity to the nature of the cult. After this scene it's pretty clear that the cult is actually evil, whereas in the theatrical cut that realisation doesn't reallllly occur until it's already too late to leave.
