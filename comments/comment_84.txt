The scariest part of the movie is not from a scene, but from the IDEA that you would very innocently agree to go along with someone you consider a friend to a foreign country, not at all knowing exactly where they're taking you or what to expect, and then, after arriving, you realize it's a cult out in the middle of nowhere, and there's no way to escape or call for help. Being someone who's traveled overseas to non-touristy areas, that notion really struck me.
