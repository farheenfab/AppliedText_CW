I've watched this a couple times now, and I just feel so sorry for both Dani and Christian. Both are used and abused for their fresh DNA.  
Both have been heavily drugged and both manipulated by the cult to get what they wanted.   Fresh meat to replace the old. 
Dani smiling at the end, it to me is a symbol that she is beginning to accept her life in the cult. She's been so manipulated that she thinks this is home now.
