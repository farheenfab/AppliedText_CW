As a Swedish person I’d just like to point out that at the start everyone is treated with a “welcome” yet dani got a “welcome home”. 
edit: probably meaning that pele wanted Danny to come and had planned this weeks in advance also you know that drawing? yeah it would have taken a long time and those symbols on it stand for “journey” and “rebirth” but since the symbol that looked like an R is inverted it makes it dark or negative so actually on the drawing he wrote “ a bad journey to rebirth” oh yeah and pelle was the one who killed josh with the sledge hammer
