One thing I’ve noticed most haven’t mentioned.. That all the non Scandinavian/Northern European looking guests were sacrificed first- you hear one of the elders say ‘we try to keep our bloodlines pure but sometimes we have to bring in outsiders’ .. so Danni and Christian were the only ones really of any use to the cult.
