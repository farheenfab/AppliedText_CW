If you are a die hard horror fan, don't go into this expecting a horror flick.  The trailers are misleading.  But it is an incredibly rewarding watch.  The cinematography was stunning, the characters and cast were outstanding, and if you happen to dig Norse or Scandinavian heritage you'll dig it. It was an unsettling movie that grabs your investment and I didn't regret it.  Just watch with an open mind and not what you think the trailers represent.
