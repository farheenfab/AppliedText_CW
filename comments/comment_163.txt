Such a perfect representation of a toxic relationship. You can see how he is gaslighting her, denying her feelings and twisting reality. Really hits home after being with a narcissist. It's always YOUR fault, you mistaken things, you are imagining things, or your actions are "misunderstood" by the narcissist. They act incongruently so that they keep you confused and off the edge. It's so cruel.
