One of the brilliant ways that this cult manipulates you is by their performance of empathy. When Dani discovers Christian with the other girl, the other women wail with her in sympathy. When the men cry out in pain as they burn alive, the group cries with them in their agony. Throughout the entire movie, Dani was alone with absolutely nobody but Pele recognizing and acknowledging her pain. Her boyfriend was cold and unfeeling, and his friends made it clear they didn't care about her either. In the end, she is led to believe she has finally found the people that will cry with her and feel her pain as she does which is all she ever really wanted.
