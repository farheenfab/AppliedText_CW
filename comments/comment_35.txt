I had to watch this movie in bits. I'm a cult survivor, and even though my cult didn't do things like this, it was still awful. I especially had to fast forward through a few of the scenes where they were being drugged. My experience had a lot to do with substances as well and it wasn't good, i've totally sworn off anything remotely mind altering because of it. It's still one of the best horror movies i've ever watched.
