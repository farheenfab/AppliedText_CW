interesting, when Josh goes to sleep in his sneakers [new balance] the camera focuses a little too long on his lower legs in shoes, the next time we see [one of] his legs it is feet-up in the herb patch with a rune on the sole. i don't know if the New balance N and the rune similarity is deliberate, but that made me chuckle. Also the fact he was 'digging too deep' about the cults' traditions and ended up dug in pretty deep himself!
