Can we take a moment to appreciate that James recognized that Christian was sexually assaulted and it was a creepy scene? I hear too many people say that the "mating ritual" scene was funny but it's actually really disturbing. I have no choice but to stan anyone who refuses to play into the "men being sexually assaulted is funny" trope. James is the best :)
