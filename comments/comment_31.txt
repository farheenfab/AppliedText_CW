As an anthropologist I can understand Josh’s mindset(at first). We are trained to be detached when studying cultures. We are not there to pass judgement or feel a certain way to customs. We are there to record and observe as much as we can while trying to stay emotionally distant. We have to have some emotionally connection to gain entry into the cultures but maintaining our “distance” is important. And culturally relativism is a huge part of our process! However,  he crossed the line and took pictures of their holy book and that is super f*cked up! That is against everything an anthropologist is trained to be
