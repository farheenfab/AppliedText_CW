Strongly disagree that Dani was better off with the cult. Christian and Dani's relationship was toxic, yes, but that doesnt make it good he ended up being burned alive. The Hargas preyed upon her trauma and vulnerability which is what cults do. Her smile at the end looked more like a nervous breakdown than a happy smile to me.
