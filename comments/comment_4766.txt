The part that really hit for me was when she was trying to move in the flower dress. How she struggled and could barely move a few feet before she had to stop. The dress was made to be restrictive just like the cult. It is a visual representation of the cult growing on her and as she tryâ€™s to move, struggles, before giving in and stopping that is representative of the movie as a whole
