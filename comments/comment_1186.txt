Something I'm seeing a lot in these comments is how "funny" it would be or how it would feel like being "mocked" for the Horgas to be crying/screaming along with you in a moment of grief. However, it's a legitimate cult tactic that WORKS. It's called Mirroring & it's meant to make you feel as if your emotions are understood and that you aren't alone. Cults are known to go after people that feel alone & have no one else. What better way to pull them in than to make sure they feel understood & heard?
