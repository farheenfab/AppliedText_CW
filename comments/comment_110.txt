One thing that really bugs me about many interpretations of this film is the idea that Christian 'cheats' on Dani. Don't get me wrong, he's a gaslighting, manipulative bastard, but in this scene he was drugged. When people in a relationship get drugged against their will and have sex it's not considered cheating, it's considered non-con. They are seen as victims, taken advantage of by the person who is sober. To say Christian cheated is not fair because he was not sober. He did not have any bearings (pun not intended) on what was happening, and was most likely fearful of the Hårga if he didn't do as they said. I only mention this because it's a really dangerous mentality to have. Just because he's a dude doesn't mean he wasn't the victim here. However, I understand there's the idea that Christian could've backed out, no one was stopping him, but again, the idea of fear, and his drug induced state comes into play here. I guess what I want to say is it's not as simple as Christian cheating. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Also on a completely different note, I wouldn't say that the metaphors show how she belongs with the Hårga. She's essentially moving from one toxic, dependant relationship, to another, whether it be Christian, or the Hårga. Dani being adopted into this new community ISN'T A GOOD THING.
