I normally hate Horror films because of all the cheap Jump scares and silly tricks they use. 
Midsommar is *exceptional*.
 I never thought a colored and bright movie can be this disturbing. 

No ghosts or Zombies are shown in this Movie... 
Just the most scary thing ever... *HUMAN*

This Movie set a New Standard for Horror Movies in my opinion!
