Netflix watchers here is something just for you.  If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, hated, used God&#39;s name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God&#39;s law, you&#39;re guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God&#39;s son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 <br> <br>God is warning the world. <br>End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, satan is ruling with his plagues, violence, idol worship, scoffers, and government control...<br>The earth is experiencing birth pains like never before, earthquakes, fires, floods. People now are lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, we see sexual immorality running rampant like adultery, fornication, homosexuality, sexual abuse rape... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), and religious persecution against Christians only (they will hate you because of me, Jesus (Matthew 10:22). <br>The world leaders are prepping for a,&quot;One-World order,&quot; a &quot;Great Reset,&quot; (please donâ€™t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there&#39;s only one alternative, eternity in darkness, suffering in a lake of fire) <br>Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, the world will be in turmoil, then the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many with his worldwide lies... then the tribulation will start, you will be forced to worship the beast and take his number. Life on earth will be horrific. <br>Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it&#39;s too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 10:9), and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace! Ephesians 4:8-9(NOT BY WORKS)
