It&#39;s clear that Sun oh  and Jojo will not end up together. In this trailer Hye-yeong said that he will wait for Jojo and in the teaser Jojo says &quot;thanks for waiting&quot;. In this trailer there&#39;s also a scene where Hye-yeong hugs Jojo on a bridge and I think that&#39;s when Jojo will ring Hye-yeong alarm. So I think that Hye-yeong and Jojo will be endgame and Sun-oh will eventually ring his girlfriend&#39;s alarm in the end, so that all of them will find happiness. I am team Sun-oh and I love him and Jojo together, I think he is a better match for her, but I am convinced that they will not be endgame
