I didn&#39;t like this series quite much. First coz the app is not reliable it doesn&#39;t tell about love it just tells about momentary attraction or else how could Sun oh&#39;s alarm ring by so many girls. Not everyone of them would have loved him. And Jojo still needed the app&#39;s confirmation for her feelings to be real or not is just something i didn&#39;t like. I hoped the S2 must have showed how these apps and all are good but in the end you have to figure it out by yourselves or something but naah Jojo was confused till the last moment. Secondly focusing on Jojo and Sun oh&#39;s character more than Hye yeong. I can understand in First season they showed more importance to their characters coz they were the leads but in the second season 2 5-6 out of 8 episodes were more focused on Sun oh and Jojo and i can understand fans who were on Sun oh side. I mean when Hye yeong wants to kiss Jojo when they are even in realtionship in S2 she decline but at the same time Sun ho can kiss her. Obviously the fans will think that she will end up with Sun oh. Lastly I don&#39;t where the last scene of S1 went she came to see if Sun oh rings her alarm or not and Hye yeong comes there too and then S1 ends and there is no explanation of it in S2
