Watching this trailer, am I the only one that thinks Jojo and Hyeyoung look better as best friends?! <br><br>Itâ€™s also interesting that there are SO many positive scenes with Hyeyoung happy but miserable scenes with Sun oh and Jojo.<br><br>My prediction is Jojo will choose to be with Sun Oh but he rejects her initially. As he should. He has been wronged in this entire situation.
