O.K. here is my two cent&#39;s worth. Season 1 Jojo went to Sun Oh house and realized they are from different worlds. In most of Asian countries social strata is very IN yet and further more she is poor without family connections and with a stigma of being the daughter of suicide scandal. San Oh is from a wealthy family,  father a politician (very much on public eyes) mother an actress he himself is famous model. JoJo is more mature and realized that there will be no good ending. Now, the rests of this drama are all stuffing to make it a story.
