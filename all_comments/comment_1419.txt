I’m sorry but Sunoh’s behaviour towards her is so fucking creepy and inappropriate, if it didn’t have romantic music it would be so uncomfortable whenever he comes on to her. just because he looks like an Instagram oppar doesn’t mean he can take someone off into an alley and refuse to believe them when they say they don’t want to kiss. No thanks lmao
