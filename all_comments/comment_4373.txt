You know what’s fucked up. Basically Jojo broke up with Sun oh over a stupid reason. And then she force her self to date his best friend because she felt bad and fell in love with him. I mean Sun oh did the same but he still loves her. She even said she regretted downloading the shield and all she could’ve done was get back together with him but nooo because she decided to fall in love with Hye young and went through the struggle of wanting to remove her shield for him when she could’ve done so with Sun oh.
