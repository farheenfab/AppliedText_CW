am i the only one who liked the ending? ðŸ˜‚<br><br>edit: okay let me explain why. at first, i was ambivalent. i wanted her to be with sun-oh, but i wanted her to be with hye-young as well. so i was fine with however the show ended. but as i continued to watch the season, i was getting annoyed with how sun-oh was acting. i also felt like jojo liked hye-young more than she liked sun-oh. <br><br>and also, i felt like choosing hye-young was the most logical choice because he did like her first. in the webtoon, he ended up with her and i feel like changing something significant like that wouldnâ€™t make sense. idk please donâ€™t hate me.
