&quot;thank you for being alive&quot;. Beautiful words from someone who is grateful to meet you and puts effort to make her happy. Idkw ppl still don&#39;t like hye-young. All the small details that he did, I wish I could find them in someone in these days. Getting a spot at library, giving a drink to feel better, looking at you how you work hard in order to be successful... I wanna meet someone like him 😭🌝💕
