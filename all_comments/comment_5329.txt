Just finished binge watching season 2.. and it literally broke my heart when sunho smiled for the first time in the entire season when jojo left and he saw high school jojo ( before she left for jeju) ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­<br>I can&#39;t stop tears ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­<br><br>Why bother making season 2 if it was not going to be sunho
