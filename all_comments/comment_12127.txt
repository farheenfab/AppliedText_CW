I&#39;m almost positive that she&#39;ll end up with Hyeyeong. For a couple reasons trailer started with him and actually showed cute scenes between them and two that the cast order at the end was Jojo/ Kim So-hyun, Hye-yeong/Jung Ga-ram, and Sun-oh/ Song Kang. Also they included a kiss between Jojo and Sun-oh which seems like a misdirect. There&#39;s also the fact she ended up with Hye-yeong in the webtoon. All this to say I&#39;d rather she end up shooting neither. Both of them are a bit odd to me. Hye-yeong kind of stalked her because he liked her so much and Sun-oh betrayed his friend as well as kissed her without consent. I don&#39;t know why I watched this show, now that I think about it, none of the characters are likeable. Huh...
