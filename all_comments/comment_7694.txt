even though i think that hye-young deserves better i still think that she should end up with sun oh because first of all he loves her so much and he was ready to be there for her for the rest of his life and also he deserves it because she broke up with him and he didn&#39;t even know the reason. he DESERVES to know the truth. from what i understood she didn&#39;t break up with him because she didnt love him so she should finally stop avoiding him and tell him how she feels. ik that hye-young liked her first but he couldn&#39;t even approach her and sun oh took the chance to know her and love her.
