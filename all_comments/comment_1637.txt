I only started eps 1 because these two are beautiful together. I love dramas with beautiful visuals as leads. It makes it more interesting.  However, the plot piss me off. If these two weren&#39;t so cute looking together, I would say they are messed up. He knew his best friend had a thing for her and he went for it. Not really sure his intentions since I only watched eps 1. Also, she has a boyfriend and she obviously cheated. Lmao I swear the plot makes me want to fight both of them. However, they are so beautiful together, that I want them together. Because, the other main lead isn&#39;t that great looking. Lmao this just makes me look like a confused idiot.
