Everyone&#39;s rooting for sun oh but I kinda feel bad for the second ML..I mean what did he do to deserve this?👀 Even in the beginning you can see that he supported the ML more than anything, he was like his shadow..and then after jojo entered their lives everything changed..even after putting so much effort into wooing her..he still didn&#39;t get her..I don&#39;t understand. 😐😐<br>And I think the FL should set her priorities right, atleast straighten your emotions first before you start giving signals to the second ML. I mean wtf is even going on..this love triangle just doesn&#39;t have an end.
