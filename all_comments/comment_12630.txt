Even if she doesnâ€™t end up with Sun-oh he deserves an explanation he literally was broken and didnâ€™t understood what he did wrong, she broke up with him out of the blue and just cut him off. Sun-oh is obviously still hurt and still canâ€™t understand why she broke up with him and I feel like In order for him to have closure and finally let go of jojo is by seeing it from her POV.<br>Also I think jojo still has some feeelings left for Sun-oh she needs to make a decision, it obvious after breaking up she regretted it by trying to buy a new phone. But now it seems she doesnâ€™t want to start a relationship with someone because she canâ€™t ring their love alarm. She needs to stop leaving it up to the app and just follow her feelings.<br>Edit: woahhhh i didnt expect this to blow up, i hope she truly likes whoever she ends up with though, whether it be sun-oh or hyeyongðŸ˜Š
