I know I came late to the party (comment section), but I really needed a space to vent. To the writers and all those who understood the ending of love alarm, let me just vent and say some facts about this movie that contradicts itself.<br>. Love is not a choice, it&#39;s a feeling. The developer created to expose the truth of how people truly feel. He himself loved a girl who hated him the most, but still he loved her. How then can Jojo truly say she loves haeyong when she has to use a feature to ring his alarm? <br>. A shield to Prevent her from ringing sunho&#39;s love alarm and a spear to ring haeyong. That in itself defeats the honesty of love alarm. If the developer had removed the shield and spear, and Jojo then rang haeyong&#39;s love alarm and not that of  sunho&#39;s, the ending could have been more truthful and bearable. But for it to end the way it did, it&#39;s Pathetic. I mean ,haeyong needed explanation that her love is real?<br>. Really, Jojo is immature and scared. She was so scared of the intensity of the love she had for Sunho and that is true love. That&#39;s why she broke up with him after verbally confessing her love.<br>. Sunho did nothing wrong. He saw a girl and went for her, while the coward heayong stood there. He asked him to turn his alarm on and let Jojo truly choose, but haeyong ran away. <br>. And again, truly nobody had a happy ending. Haeyong is with Jojo who chose him because he is safe for her and not Sunho who she truly loves, Sunho is with someone whom he will never ring her love alarm unless he gets the spear?*, <br>And Jojo, the worst of them all, her character is weak, frightened and dishonest, even to herself. That&#39;s why her friend left her and why she does not deserve either sunho or haeyong&#39;s love. I mean even after ringing haeyongs love alarm, she still looked unhappy and depressed. You can compare her joy when she rang that of Sunho in season 1. <br>So in all, there could have been a better ending with the story, this one just doesn&#39;t ring true. In my opinion. There, now I can breathe.
