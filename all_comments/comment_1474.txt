I love how Love Alarm ruined human connections in some ways.. remember at the start of Love Alarm, he didnt need an alarm to tell him that she liked him, he knew by looking into her eyes but by the last episode even when he looked into her eyes, because his Love Alarm didnt ring from her, he thought she didnt love him.. very interesting stuff
