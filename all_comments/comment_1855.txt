I don&#39;t care is Sun oh and Jojo end up together, but if these ppl are going to do so, freaking leave Hye young out of it. Why giving him hope?? He was the one who patiently waited all these years without dating anyone or trying to move on. Wtf is wrong with this girl? Don&#39;t keep changing your stances. Take a decision and act accordingly you idiot sandwich. And why is this sunoh forcing kisses again? Ughh
