Who said theres no chemistry between Hye Yeong &amp; Jojo????! Did yall miss the part where they literally held each others hands through both of their personal traumas from the very beginning? The silent understanding? The patience? The comfort? The humor? The fact that you guys think Sun-Oh is a better partner is WILD to me. He literally yelled at everyone, was demanding, pushy, and never considered JoJos comfort or feelings only his own. Sun-oh got the ending he deserved frankly &amp; season 2 was EXACTLY what I was looking for.
