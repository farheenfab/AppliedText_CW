I guess you guys should re-watch the drama and analyze the flow of the story lol. Sun Oh fell in love with her at first sight. As he said, no one ever stares at him like Jojo did. That means that all of the other girls are just interested in him because of his looks and his family is well off. For him, Jojo is different from them that&#39;s why he became interested. Even if Sun Oh didn&#39;t met Jojo just because of Hye Yeong, he will still fall in love with her.<br><br>*Sun Oh didn&#39;t stalk Jojo when you look forward to episode 1. Sun Oh just coincidentally met her in front of the bus stop (when Sun Oh also don&#39;t want to go home) and gets confused of why she didn&#39;t get in the bus. Sun Oh&#39;s personality is kinda nasty and straight-forward but PURE. He wants to kiss Jojo because he fell in love. Again, straight-forward but pure.<br><br>*Jojo on the other hand, fell in love with Sun Oh without her realizing it. The fact that she told her secret to Sun Oh the first time they met is an obvious hint. She never told anyone about her past even her bestfriend. She felt comfortable with Sun Oh and didn&#39;t even move back to the kiss he did.<br><br>*It is also obvious that they both really love each other. It&#39;s just that an incident happened that made them apart. Jojo not just like but also loves Sun Oh that&#39;s why she broke up with him. And Jojo is still in love with him even 4 years had passed; she gets affected to the fact that Sun Oh is with the other girl now. Having your tears fell down is a sign that you still love that person. She has nothing to do but to hide her feelings and let go til&#39; she move on. She sacrificed her happiness for Sun Oh&#39;s sake.<br><br>*Disregarding what happened to the webtoon and in the drama, we will think that she will end up with Sun Oh, right? And they deserve to have a happy ending with each other&#39;s hands. Hye Young is what we think more of a soulmate. But Jojo deserves to be happy with what she really love. Webtoon is on-going so we&#39;ll see what happens in the future.<br><br>Ps. Take a look at their Promotional Poster. It&#39;s as if Sun Oh is the male lead and they filmed more on SunOhxJojo moments.
