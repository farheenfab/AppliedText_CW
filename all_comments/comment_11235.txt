I&#39;m I the only one rooting for Hye yeong... as I could remember form season 1, Hye Yeong was the 1st interested with Jojo, but he told Sun oh, and he immediately went to Jojo and  fall for her? I watch it some times ago, so I could not remeber correctly now, sorry if I&#39;m wrong... I was rooting for Hye Yeong from the very beginning, now I still rooting for him.. <br>I do like Song Kang, he nailed it in Sweet Home, but in this series, I&#39;ll go for Jojo &amp; Hye Yeong...
