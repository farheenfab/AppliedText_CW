I&#39;ve never hated the end of a k-drama as blatantly as this .. I had hoped until the end that Sun-oh and jo-jo would find each other again .. which unfortunately didn&#39;t happen.  I also don&#39;t understand this “fake” love between Sun-oh and Yuk-Jo (I think it was called that), it doesn&#39;t do any good.<br><br>this is not meant to be a hate, just a criticism
