Every episode of this season mentions the other guy. The current episode shows her being with this other guy. I stopped watching because I don&#39;t want it. The 1st guy she left didn&#39;t even have a sin to her. She left because of her past trauma and got scared and left without explanation. No I don&#39;t want it.
