This one seems to bring out her true emotions. The other one is easy love she hides behind him. For crying out loud she cannot even kiss the guy she claims to like. Yet the one i think she likes she keeps on running away from him. Hope she will stop running and face her true fillings. Its like it is so hard for her to move forward .................. well its drama :)
