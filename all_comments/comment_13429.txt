at this point i dont mind who ends up with who all I just want for them is to have their own character development, especially sunoh because up until now, im still pissed for kissing jojo, when jojo is clearly still in a relationship  with someone and also for jojo, i hope she resolve her conflicts also before being in a relationship  because from what i can see hyeyeong is the only one who is really mature and ready  for a relationship and deserves so much better
