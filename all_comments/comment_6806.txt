If Jojo leads Hye young on just to cheat on him with Sun-oh (like she did with her ex-boyfriend) then she needs to be straight to him and let him go. It looks like she chose him from the trailer so they must be together. I really think she needs to choose no one and work on finding out what she wants. The love alarm is just doing more harm than good. I think Hye young is the better choice and shouldn&#39;t be lead on like this as he genuinely wants the best for Jojo. I don&#39;t want him to get hurt over and over again.
