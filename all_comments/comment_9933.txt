HYE-YEONG BEST BOY!!!<br><br>I want him to end up with Jojo because he (is the first who) loves her (even from afar.) Hye-yeong is willing to prove to Jojo how much he loves her, even in the expense that his feelings might not be reciprocated and he might get hurt, just to see Jojo smile and have to courage to love again. If Hye-yeong will not end up with Jojo, at least let him have a happy ending. HYE-YEONG DESERVES A HAPPY ENDING.
