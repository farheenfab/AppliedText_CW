This is what I get after waiting for 2nd season  for more than 1 and a half year? I was a huge fan of love alarm and I literally counted months and days for this season, hoping to see the couple I ship together. <br>It feels like they just used sun oh to gain the popularity. I mean, the storyline was completely changed! How can  you be so cruel to Sun oh? He was the lead in season 1, but it felt like they didn&#39;t even considered him at all now! The one hurting wasn&#39;t jojo, it was Sun oh - all the time! <br>It was a huge disappointment! <br><br>PS: I appreciate the actors and the production team for their efforts. And I love song kang ;p‚ù§
