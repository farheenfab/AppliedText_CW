Im soo happy with the ending first time kdrama ends at something happening in real .jojo deserves best not some stupid guy kissing suddenly . jojo was meant to be with hyeyeong oppa from start . I love it im proud of the directors taking the risk to put love by choice even tho they knew some ppl will not understand this plot n go against it amazing
