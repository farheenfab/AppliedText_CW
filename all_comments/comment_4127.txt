Did Jojo want to break up just because they got hurt in the motorbike accident and then they couldn&#39;t see each other after his dad locked him up? She said &#39;It&#39;s not because I don&#39;t like you... it&#39;s because I&#39;m scared&quot; - I still don&#39;t understand why she switched from Sun-oh to Hye-yeon just like that.
