Y&#39;all can keep swearing or throw hands already COZ WAKE UP IT&#39;S NOT SUN OH. It&#39;s always been hye yeong even in the webtoon. The point of this drama is basically loving without caring about that damn app and that&#39;s what hye yeong love is all about. If she would end up with sun oh (which she basically won&#39;t) then the whole point will be missed out.
