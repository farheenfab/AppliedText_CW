In my opinion, in the special trailer for sun-oh and jojo in the last part, jojo ran in black boots, white jeans, and a brownish shirt to meet sun-oh. And in the love alarm 2 trailer the last part jojo says &quot;who do i like&quot; with the same clothes and black boots, the screen is the same palace. Basically they of course meet each otherðŸ¤”ðŸ¥º.
