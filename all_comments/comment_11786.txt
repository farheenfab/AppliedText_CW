<b>Listen guys!</b> at Time stamp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=21">0:21</a>, I&#39;m ðŸ’¯ percent sure that it&#39;s THE ENDING SCENE and Jojo chose HYE YEONG. Based on the last day of filming in their set, those were the clothes the two wore, and Sun Oh was nowhere to be found on the pics the staffs has uploaded. So im sure she chose Hye Young. Come back to my comment when they released the love alarm 2 and tell me otherwise! ðŸ‘€ðŸ¥±
