Okay, it&#39;s fine jojo end up with hye yeong and the story line about jojo trying to show hye yeong that she love him so much, BUT Sun Oh love her from the start to the end until about 10 minutes before the story finish end. He moved on. Is it fair for Sun Oh, he know nothing about the shield and jojo love alarm and the only girl he love from the start end up with his bestfriend. Have you ever feel how to move on. It&#39;s not Sun Oh fault at all. And jojo just moved on like that make me speechless. And the story line of this story is really suddenly and not specific about the relationship of Sun Oh and his girlfriend, and jojo and hye yeong. <br><br>NO HATE, OKAY<br>THAT&#39;S ALL
