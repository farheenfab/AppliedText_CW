I really don&#39;t care who she ends up with cause they&#39;re both great guys for her, as long as she is happy cause girl has been through so much so she deserves to be happy. Though I kinda feel bad for Sun Oh so a little bit biased to him but Hye Yeong is so selfless and unconditionally loves her so I&#39;m fine with whoever she ends up with.
