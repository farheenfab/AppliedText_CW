Although I&#39;m really very excited to watch this,but if she isn&#39;t ending up with Sun Oh then I&#39;m not interested in watching! I know it&#39;s completely based on some kind of webtoon but dude, I want a change in the ending.... please ðŸ˜­ I don&#39;tt even remember name of the other guy, so how could you expect me to keep calm after watching this trailer!  (Ps:- I really really love you Song Kang)
