I hate the season 2 of Love alarm. Specially the ending has made me heartbroken. When I watched Sunho and Jojo together, it felt so real and perfect. Though I was sad for Hyun Jo, I wanted a good ending for him. But season 2 has made me mad. Sunho has loved her so much. He has begged to love him when she broke up with him without any explanation. Even when he was not at fault, he apologised to her again and again without any reason. He begged for her her love in front of the whole school even after knowing how much pathetic he looked. When he got his girlfriend, he never stopped loving her. Even when he didn&#39;t know Jojo&#39;s past, he trusted her blindly and gave her space.Sunho never wanted to give up on Jojo. He cried a lot for her. All she did was to overlook his emotions. I will always hate the makers for giving him such a bad ending. Sunho deserves much better.
