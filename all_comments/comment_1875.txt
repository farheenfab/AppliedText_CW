Is the plot still not enough SWOON that you guys are giving Sun-oh fans more pain. <br>It hurts damn for waiting for 2yrs to let the girl be sorry for leaving him when he needed her the most. He needed her always yet 2nd season sucked us to death. <br>Felt this drama as it feels real which happens or have happened to everyone. Unrequited love is meant to be felt painfully.
