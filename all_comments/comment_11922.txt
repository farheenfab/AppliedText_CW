Watch them force Jojo and Hye yeong together<br><br><br><br>I just don’t think they have the chemistry and hye yeong isn’t developed enough as a character. He’s too perfect and doesn’t seem like an actual human who makes mistakes. If they develop him well in this next season I won’t be mad but I feel in my heart that Sun oh and Jojo should be endgame. If she ends up with hye yeong they’re really going to have to sell it to me but I just don’t see it.
