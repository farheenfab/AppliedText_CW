<b>***SPOILER****</b><br><br><br><br><br>So I know lots of people are disappointed with the ending, but I think it ended the best that it could have. Sun-oh and Jojo really loved and cared for each other, but I think that during that time, they were both lonely and broken inside and found comfort in having someone there to relieve their problems (family issues, their past, anxiety, pressures, etc). But as they both grew as individuals, I think hye-young was the right choice for Jojo because the feelings developed came more from loving each other as a whole, rather than depending on each other.
