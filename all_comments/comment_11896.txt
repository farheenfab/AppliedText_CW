I want, that jojo and hye yeong become a couple, because hye yeong liked her first and he truly loves her. He did so many things for her and he is even waiting for her. But I also want that sun oh is happy at the end and that theyâ€˜re still friends. Jojo also needs to explain everything to sun oh because there is still a hole. But after all I want that everyone is happy at the end.
