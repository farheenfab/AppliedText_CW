ðŸ’Ÿ <b>MY IDEAL ROUTE:</b> ðŸ’Ÿ <br><br><i>&quot;Hyeyeong Soulmate Version&quot;</i> <br> <br>Love is facing your demons and confronting your fears. <br><br><b>&quot;Just go. I&#39;m fine, I don&#39;t feel lonely.&quot;</b> betraying the truth about herself, she told him that night. Pushing him away. <br><br><b>&quot;That&#39;s because you felt lonely for so long. You don&#39;t even realize you feel that way.&quot;</b> <br><br>She felt vulnerable. <b>&quot;You don&#39;t know me well enough to say that!&quot;</b><br><br>When Hyeyoong stared at her, it was as if he wasn&#39;t looking at her but at the inner parts of her soul. <b>&quot;How can I not? When I see it all clearly&quot;</b><br><br>It was when the wall that she&#39;d instinctively built around herself begins to crack. It&#39;s pretty frightening to be vulnerable, but love forced her to. He walked up to her, a calm and gentle smile upon his face. Her heart was comforted. Every inch of her soul felt warm. <br><br><br>Hyeyeong was the first person who reached out a hand for her broken half. <br><br><b>&quot;Thank you for being alive, Jojo.&quot;</b><br><br><br>She realized love can be calm, it can overwhelming sense of peace. She realized that love is finding someone who feels like home.
