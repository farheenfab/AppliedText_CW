[spoilers] <br><br><br><br><br>probably a minority opinion, but i like the ending, or more specifically, that jojo and hyeyoung ended up together. i&#39;ve seen jojo &amp; sunoh&#39;s relationship story over and over again in dramaland and i&#39;m glad the writer/s of love alarm chose a different, more refreshing, and better relationship to end this show with. chemistry can only take you so far. the kind of love jojo and hyeyoung have may be quieter and less glamorous, but it&#39;s grounded on friendship, trust, selflessness(!), and mutual respect for each other. those relationships are the ones that last, frankly, the kind we should see more in kdramas, in my opinion.<br><br><br>and lmaoo, the hate people have over the end couple... goes to show that y&#39;all are willing to excuse toxic behavior for a pretty face ðŸ˜‘
