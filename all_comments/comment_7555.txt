She will end up with Sun-oh in the end (cross fingers). If you see this trailer, the app now shows someone who might like you. On Hye-yeong&#39;s phone it shows Jojo might like him and then after Sun Oh kissed her and said that he will only believe Jojo&#39;s eyes, the thing in Hye-yeong&#39;s love alarm app disappeared or something happened to it. Jojo&#39;s feelings for Sun Oh is still there. She still loves him, that&#39;s why she asked Hye-yeong why he&#39;s not getting mad about what happened. So Jojo and Sun Oh might end up together in the end. I mean atleast these are the only hope I got from this trailer.
