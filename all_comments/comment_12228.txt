The updated version of the app can tell that someone can possibly fall for you. HY told JJ that the app says it&#39;s possible for her to like him, then showed her his phone with the pics of the two of them on the app. But in the next scene, the pic of JJ faded away which means only one thing. It only means that the possibility of her liking him was gone. Maybe that&#39;s because the app detected that&#39;s she&#39;s still inlove with SO.<br><br>And that&#39;s why HY told her he wouldn&#39;t bother with the app. But maybe out of guilt or pity, JJ told him she likes him (cuz the app can&#39;t do it for her, cuz it knows who she really likes and that&#39;s not HY) <br><br>THAT&#39;S JUST A MAYBE THO.
