I&#39;ve watched the whole season 2 I promise!!!<br><br>To be honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting Jojo to end up with Hye Yeong. Before watching I was thinking that maybe Jojo will end up with Sun Oh since he was the male lead. But as I was watching the season 2? It was so obvious that Jojo liked Hye Yeong and Sun Oh was about to fall to that other girl. I was literally screaming &quot;why is this so frustrating?&quot; It was like I was the love alarm app telling Jojo to like Sun Oh when it was already written in her face that she likes Hye Yeong already. To be honest... The ending was realistic and it was nothing I have ever seen before. Tho I still like Sun Oh that was why I was hurting so much. All I was thinking was &quot;I will come to like this ending too, like how Sun Oh will come to like the other girl&quot;<br><br>Man... I hate the ending but it is so realistic indeed.
