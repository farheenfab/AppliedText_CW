I&#39;ve been rewatching the first season to watch the second one with a fresh memory and all I have to say is: Sun-oh and Hye-young should end up together.<br>I always thought the beginning of the story was super weird. Imagine: You come back home after a long time and you want to meet your childhood friend. You hold him very close to your heart because he was there when you had no one else and he was your only support. But then you realize that he&#39;s not paying attention to you because he&#39;s in love with some girl you don&#39;t even know. So you start watching this girl, wondering if he likes her (which is pretty obvious and even when Sun-oh wanted a direct answer from Hye-young, he already knew what that was going to be). To me, the beginning of the story looks like blantant jealousy from Sun-oh. Then things get weirder, Sun-oh is pretty much sure his only friend is in love with this girl and after watching her for a while, he decides he wants to kiss her. The only apparent reason being that she is different than everybody else because she actually makes eye-contact with him. Got to admit, I think both romances are kind of weird, but a least we get to see Sun-oh and Jojo relationship develop throughout the series.<br>And then comes a really painful episode in which Hye-young and Sun-oh years long friendship ends because they both like the same girl. I haven&#39;t rewatched this episode yet, but I remember hating it and thinking it was very dumb, even more so after all the cute flashbacks we got of them.<br>I don&#39;t know why I wrote this long paragraph about something probably no one cares about, but I guess I just wanted to get my thoughts out here. I don&#39;t care much about who she ends up with, I just hope everyone gets to be happy and truthful to their feelings.<br>(English is not my native language, so I hope this is readable).
