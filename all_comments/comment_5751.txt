Majority of the comments are team sunoh huh, but c&#39;mon guys is it the time you realize that hye yeong is the best for her. Can&#39;t you see how happy jojo is when she is with him? And how with sunoh all she gets are trouble from the very start, when he kiss her even though he does not like her that time. But of course I respect your ship. BUT STILL TEAM HYEYEONG FTW!!
