I think the ending couldn&#39;t have been more perfect! <br>The ending taught us something! If she ended up with sun oh then it wouldn&#39;t have been such a beautiful ending! Because what this ending says is that after all the love alarm app isn&#39;t perfect, and your heart is even more certain! She decided to use the only arrow on the person she believed she loved and wanted to ring his love alarm so that he would be happy! It means that, if she had never used that shield she would follow an application, but with it, she was actually true to her true feelings! See? I was expecting her to end up with hye-yeong but wasn&#39;t expecting the ending would be so thoughtful! <br>Seriously guys, even still, didn&#39;t lee hye-yeong made her a lot happier than sun oh?? I mean, he thought of her and not of himself, (when sun oh did that thing in the classroom, wich made her so uncomfortable), always waiting probably indefinitely, just so many reasons that put him above sun ho! I know sun ho didn&#39;t do anything and deserved her to, but people move on, and that&#39;s what happened, and she is a lot happier!  I don&#39;t understand how it could have been the other way around! I prefer an ending that has a morality and this was it!<br>ps: And the part of sun ho and Lee Yuk-Jo and the doorbell thing was very beautiful! Again, contradicting the application by deciding to try his best to love her!
