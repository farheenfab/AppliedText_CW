The season 2 is watchable without watching season 1. They disregarded some points in the first season which made other viewers disappointed. It isn&#39;t just because of the “endgame”. It&#39;s how they disregarded the cliffhanger. It was never mentioned or shown in the whole season 2. There are points which they did not clarified like how Jojo &amp; HY started dating. Yuk-jo was actually a better character than Jojo. Jojo should&#39;ve got mental help on her trauma &amp; experiences from her childhood. The show focused on the lesson about the app, love, etc. Without considering mental help &amp; clarification. Some people blame Sun-Oh because he liked her even if Hye-yeong was first, but they don&#39;t blame Jojo who left Suho dumbfounded wondering why she left &amp; why she broken up with him. There are a lot of points which I consider as slow-paced which gave a boring scene. I managed to finish it  and I can say, it&#39;s a diff. drama with some backstory.
