You know at the start I was mad that she didn&#39;t end up with sunho, but after season 2 it just makes sense. It&#39;s that right person wrong time thing. Their love was just too sudden and so it just suddenly ended as well. With hyeyeong on the other hand ;) I feel like it was more genuine and love-like. I feel like jojo and sunho were perfect for each other in the beginning of season one, they needed each other then, but afterwards that couldn&#39;t be possible even if he still loved her. We never truly know what the love alarm picks up on, so who knows if his love is a true one or just a comfortable//longing one :/ just like how his mom mentioned, his dad cheats on her yet he rings her alarm 😐😂 it&#39;s truly a beautiful drama that just pulls at me :] I&#39;m excited for season  ^^ who knows what will be of it?? Maybe that lie alarm combo LOL where sunho asks jojo if she&#39;s over him 🤓 and she indeed isn&#39;t.
