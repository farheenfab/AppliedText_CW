I canâ€™t understand why I feel so miserable for sun ohðŸ˜¢.At the s1, it was Jo Jo who broke up with sun oh at first and since then sun oh still love jo jo so much. But in the trailer, we can see that they both still loving each other and I think that sun oh deserves to have someone who loves him and he loves too. And that absolutely is jo jo. Besides, I still remember their romantic love friendship in s1. Team sun oh foreverrrâœŠâœŠâœŠ
