A little disappointed, the story seemed to drop off a bit after their accident until it picked up again later.  And the the girl could never get over her past to make up her mind about loving Sun-oh and he bounced around like a rubber ball, poor guy. while she tried to sort it all out and make up her mind.  This wasn&#39;t the best romantic drama I&#39;ve seen.  Got a little impatient from it.  At the end of the show, she still can&#39;t choose who she loves.  Disappointing.
