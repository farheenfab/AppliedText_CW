I just can&#39;t understand what the heck is Jojo doing!!!! I feel really bad for Sun-ohðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶ He still loves Jojo and waits for her to get her feeling for him back even though she told she doesn&#39;t like him while being so cold hearted. Cold hearted in the sense she only thought bout her at the moment they broke up. She could have atleast said Sun-oh the reason for the breakup as she is insecure or so. But she didn&#39;t. Hye-yeong needs to be a loyal friend. After Sun-oh clearly asked him many times, he said that he doesn&#39;t have feelings for Jojo and as a true friend I dont think it&#39;s right for him to like Jojo or make her like him or wait for Jojo to like him. As Jojo brokeup with Sun-oh, he should support Sun-oh. This is my opinion and I&#39;m stating the facts here. No hate here.
