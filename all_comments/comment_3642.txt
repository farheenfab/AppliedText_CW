I really like hye yeong character, its the best green flag man for me. garam play the role perfectly. Hye yeong is best character for a man: Patience, Loyal, sweet, hardwork, responsible, kind, just perfect. Plus jung ga-ram visual really2 handsome for me. I just know song kang dan jung garam from this drama. Truly I start watching this cos i saw video cut about sun oh n so hyun. But in the end i really falling in love with Hyeyeong . Hope Garam will get better drama n brighter carrier in the future. Really appreciate scriptwriter and all crew too for making beautiful drama n beautiful ending. If Iam Jojo i will also choose hye yeong being my man or husband. <br>For so Hyun acting is always awesome. Always love her. <br>Thanks Love Alarm that have given me so much lesson for knowing what true &amp; mature love is.. i already repeat watching S1 &amp; S2 all episode maybe 3 times only in this week. ‚ù§
