I have never hated an ending THIS MUCH. Sun Ohs relationship is literally “fake it till you make it”... like you cant like someone by faking it... I don’t understand why the girl that was in love with sun oh said “he will like you his entire life because i know i will” then Sun Oh tries to forget her. Im really disappointed in the ending, I was expecting to see at least why she would choose Hye Yeong, but he is still the same as season 1. Dont get me wrong i know that this is realistic, but still knowing Sun Ohs story it feels wrong to have such ending
