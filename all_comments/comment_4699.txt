Well Hye Young indeed is &quot;the complete package&quot; but then I watched Season 1 again after watching season 2 and I just felt bad for SunOh. He was there for Jojo when her life was so miserable, when friends turned their backs on her, when she was alone and struggling. And Jojo was there for SunOh when his life was such a wreck too and then they broke up. JUST like that.  I mean their love story deserved a second chance too. Right?. The series and actors are good and all, just waiting 2 years for this was....not what I was expecting. Every episode was heart wrenching unlike in S1.
