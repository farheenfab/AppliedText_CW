Sun-Oh is so sensitive and emotional, who really depends on other people and Jojo just brings the best out of him. It&#39;s like she makes him feel whole. Whereas Hye-young is such a strong man mentally that he doesn&#39;t really need Jojo, but still loves her. The difference between Sun-Oh and Hye-young is that Sun-Oh loves and needs her, and Hye-young simply loves her on top of himself.
