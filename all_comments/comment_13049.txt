I mean the app can’t really differentiate se*ual attraction with love so basically I assume that what the writers want to show and that’s why she seems like she’s confused .. I mean if it was that easy to know who she likes based on the app then we  don’t even need a second season .. with hye yeong she craves the comfort and that’s also love .. some loves don’t make you heart go crazy it just gives warmth and the security. With sunho their will always be a se*ual attraction I mean that’s why their relationship basically began with two people (kinda stranger)  kissing .. but also their break up didn’t really had a closure but it’s important to have closure in any relationship that ends. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next relationship or step in life  and that’s what she needs too.. tbh closure..
