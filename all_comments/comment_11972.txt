Everyone here is saying that sun oh doesn&#39;t deserve to be with jojo. I just don&#39;t get it. All he did was love her wih whole heart. And to clarify those saying that hye yeong is respectful and all, don&#39;t forget sunoh saying &quot;why, is girl a thing. She will choose who she likes.&quot; And in return he got nothing but his heart broken and tonns of hate. He is still unable to love another for he didn&#39;t get a closure. I just hope he get a happy ending even without jojo. And hye yeong seriously need to get over his inferiority complex. I feel like he has one. Jojo need to start loving herself first before anyone else.<br>And for the love of god, don&#39;t take this as a hye yeong bashing comment. I love them both equally and would be happest if their bromance end on a happy note.
