The fact that Jojo CHOSE to ring Hye Young’s love alarm says it all: In a world where an app can determine who you like and who you will like, they still can’t control who you choose to love. <br>Jojo chose him not because of an app, but because of what her heart and mind says.<br>It was the same with Hye Young, he liked her even without the app telling him so (or as later revealed- before the app even existed)
