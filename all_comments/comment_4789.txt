<b>Spolier</b> : I understand that half of the community is pissed at Love Alarm 2; Jojo and Sun-Oh did not end up together.<br><br><br>But, hear me out: J and S relationship in Season 1 was toxic to begin with. Their attraction for each other was strong, I&#39;d give you that, but it was far from love. S had attached himself to J, even though there were people who pointed out that S and Hye-Young were pals; S knew H liked J and kept poking at H if he would confess.<br>When J broke up with S, it felt diabolical to many because we assumed how they were still attracted to each other. But, if you look at how J was working on her own childhood experience; she didn&#39;t know if she was worthy of love and belonging, she felt like she was a burden because she survived after her parents tried to kill themselves and her. In S2, she even admitted herself she was afraid to show her scars to S, she couldn&#39;t show vulnerability to others and herself.<br><br><br>H, on the other hand, was patient and took the courage to approach J and they started going out in S2. Some, I mean more people saw how J was forcing herself to date H. On the contrary, love takes time. Real r/s can be formed when you see couple support each other during tough times, when they are going through stress, how do they response to their partner. J and H supported each other when they were under stress.<br><br><br>S would later learned about J&#39;s experience and stories, and  in his own way - let  go - was really great; letting go is also letting in.<br>*these words are for people who decide to read and see a varying side of Love Alarm &lt;3<br>I have learned so much from these individuals :<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/drnuramowzoon/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/drnuramowzoon/?hl=en</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYX4s1DCn51Hpf1peHS30Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYX4s1DCn51Hpf1peHS30Q</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYX4s1DCn51Hpf1peHS30Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYX4s1DCn51Hpf1peHS30Q</a><br>Please check them out!
