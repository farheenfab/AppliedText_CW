The whole point was to show how she lost what she wanted because she didn’t depend on her own feelings and initiative and instead trusted technology. She didn’t know who she wanted because she stopped making decisions as she thought the app would tell her. I think the writers did an excellent job. Sun oh and Jojo did have chemistry but it was the moment they had the most chemistry where she realised she didn’t want him. Yes they had tension, but apart from that they had no understanding. The girl Sun oh ended up with respected him and let him choose same with Jojo’s boyfriend. That was something Sun oh didn’t let Jojo choose. Instead of understanding her he was straight up saying statements that she liked him when in reality he never gave her a decision. She didn’t put the shield up because she loved him, she put the shield up because she didn’t want to hurt him. And what could possibly hurt Sun Oh more than Jojo not loving him?
