We&#39;re not saying Hye-yeong isn&#39;t a good boyfriend. We&#39;re saying that HY&#39;s character isn&#39;t realistic that much. His personality doesn&#39;t even have that “pure” emotions. He was always putting others before himself. I guess Jojo just like him because he&#39;s always the “good guy” that doesn&#39;t get angry even if what she does actually affects him mentally &amp; emotionally. He hides his sadness with the smile on his face and doesn&#39;t let it out.
