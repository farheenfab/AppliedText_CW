Jojo and Sunoh needed someone to love them and they found each other. One of the main reasons I’m <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunoh">#teamSunoh</a> is that he brought her so much joy, was there for her during her toughest times and made her feel special. Yes, they do come from different financial backgrounds but their family situations are both fucked up to say the least so they’re quite similar in a way. But that didn’t matter - they had each other and made each other happy. Jojo brought out the best in Sunoh and vice versa. And yes, it may have been a bit disrespectful and selfish of Sunoh to make a move on his best friend’s crush who also had a boyfriend at the time, but it’s a fact she needed someone and that someone was Sunoh. His friend would have never made a move let’s be real and Jojo would have still been alone. Sunoh fought for her (well, got beaten up to be more accurate) and I do believe they deserve a happy ending together. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sunjo">#SunJo</a>
