DISAPPOINTMENT!!! That&#39;s all that I got from this sequel... not even worth watching. Still love Kim So-Hyun, but the writers of this sequel sucks!!! I know this is just my opinion but,  please refrain from making any k-drama again... and try  not to drag Kim So Hyun from garbage projects like this.
