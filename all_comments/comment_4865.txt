I felt bad for watching this season, definitely regretted it. I mean, Hye-Yeong.. he&#39;s good, okay? He deserve to have a happy ending but I feel no chemistry at all with him and Jojo. Been waiting for this season but I AM DISAPPOINTED. Sun Oh doesn&#39;t deserve all the pain, it is so frustrating seeing him just being so miserable in this drama. You see, in the first season, they made us love Sun Oh. Most scenes were Sun Oh and Jojo. Like, what&#39;s the point of too much exposure of Sun Oh if he wouldn&#39;t end up with the main character, right? Also, Gulmi, gladly, had a character development. But yeah I get it, Jojo ended up with Hye-Yeong. Jojo&#39;s always confused, like brroooo HAHAHAHA never been disappointed like this after watching a kdrama, surely I will never get over this aackk it would&#39;ve been better if there is no season 2 or she ended up choosing herself. Give Sun Oh a justice!!! My heart is aching lol someone help me, jebal!<br>Edited my comment lol I tried rewatching it again but nah, I&#39;m not having itðŸ˜­
