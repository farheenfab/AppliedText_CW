I am so dissatisfied and disappointed with this. I was waiting years for this to come out, And most of us all wanted her with sun ho and apart from that she broke his heart for literally no reason and left him like that. both her relationship and sun ho relationship with the other partners seemed quite forced to me.... not much chemistry and connection.... <br>don&#39;t know what to say but it felt like a waste of time for me and I watched it just for the story to see what happens with the developers, the plot, that guy and stuff like that, to be honest I was excited seeing her cousin doing the mission more then her love life...
