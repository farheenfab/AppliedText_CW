I watched season 1 of this and only watched the last few moment of season 2 just to see who she ended up with. All i have to say is I was most disappointed and really happy i didn&#39;t watch season 2. What she did to this guy was cruel, selfish and disgusting. He really really loved her and she selfishly trampled on his heart. <br>I couldn&#39;t fault his friend though because they always agreed that the decision was hers. She even broke her first boyfriends heart. Didn&#39;t like this fl at all.
