SPOILER<br><br>why we want sun oh endgame? first, jojo is literally the happiest person in the world when when they were together (technically both lol). second, sun oh doesn&#39;t deserve jojo&#39;s treatment after they broke up. jojo doesn&#39;t even bother to tell sun oh the reasons why she made that decision and leave sun oh hanging like that. and lastly, they have a wholeass chemistry and i will cry if they didn&#39;t end up together u_u some of you really try to make sun oh bad for jojo. yes he did some stupid ass decisions but those are not just sun oh&#39;s decision it&#39;s also jojo&#39;s (cheating).
