Season -2  will be available at Netflix on March 12, 2021......i&#39;m hoping that Jojo and Sun-oh will be together ...even though as what i&#39;ved observed Sun-oh is a spoiled brat may be because of his status in the society but he really loves Jojo taking all the consequences in kissing Jojo a very aggressive guy when it comes to his personal feelings.... In the other side Hye Yeong is a more matured and careful  in making decisions in life and before he makes a move on one thing he see to it that it is the right thing to do.....  unrequitted love if he will not be choosen by Jojo but at least he was a man enough to stand for what he feels!....still fighting for Sun-oh!😁😁😁😁  ❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
