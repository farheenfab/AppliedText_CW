Spoiler <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I’m glad with what happened. People’s feeling change over time, and not everyone ends up with their first love. Did Jojo like Sun-ho at one time? Yes. But just as she used the shield to hide her emotions, Sun-ho gave up on her after she stoped making is alarm ring(which just made it looked like he’s love for her wasn’t real). Even when Jojo didn’t make Hye-Yeong alarm ring, he still loved her(how he felt was more important than the Love Alarm). She changed over the years, she developed a mature relationship with Hye-Yeong, and most importantly, all her actions were her choices. She chose the shield, she chose the spear, she chose Hye-Yeong.
