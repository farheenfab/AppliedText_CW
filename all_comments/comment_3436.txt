I feel like in season 2 when they &quot;make uo&quot; or kiss it wil be either, at the bus stop, the alleyway with rain as they kiss, or it will be on the bridge where they showed there feelings, the only thing is that I dont know how they will go there, maybe the developer will specially make a hardware or glitch on sun-oh and jojo phones to tell them to go the place and they will show the mark of how many people like them yeah yeah, then say there im sorry&#39;s and i love you, or im never letting you go like the ice rink then kiss, idk im just waiting on the season 2, someone remind me if sun-oh and jojo get together, if not i dont want to hear it since i will cry the 5 time this whole day, thank u
