Bruh Hyeyoung literally did the right thing before and is still doing the right thing now. The boy had a crush on this girl but didnâ€™t do anything because sheâ€™s in a relationship. Boyâ€™s best friend suddenly comes to steal the girl while sheâ€™s IN a relationship. Boy once again didnâ€™t do anything because he knew they liked each other and even helped them communicate. Suddenly the two broke up and literally left the other one for years. Boy didnâ€™t do anything again in those years out of respect for his best friend. The boy then decided to open up his feelings thatâ€™s been kept up for YEARS (which is healthy btw), boy didnâ€™t even care about his feelings being unreciprocated. Boy always knew his feelings for the girl without the app and not out of pity or anything. <br><br>Now, the boyâ€™s best friend is still being chosen over him because i donâ€™t fucking know why but whatever it is, it needs to stop.<br><br>ITâ€™S ABOUT TIME, MY BOY HYEYOUNG DESERVES ALL THE LOVE AND SUPPORT AND I STAND BY THATðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜¤
