I feel jojo is really guilty about hurting sun-oh’s feelings. That she couldn’t give him a good enough reason why she broke up with him. She just fell out of love. That was just it and she couldn’t explain why. 😔 I remember the car scene when Sun-oh kept telling her that she still likes him. She just said, “I was still immature back then. I was the one who broke your trust. How could I still like you?”<br><br>It wasn’t her trying to conceal her feelings. She just didn’t like him as much anymore and was already starting to feel something for Hye-yeong. That’s why she said she’d give Hye-yeong a chance. That’s one of the cruelties in real life. You can’t force someone to love you or stay with you. 🤷🏻‍♀️
