I hope that there will be a season 3---but not a season where he and Jojo would be the endgame, but the season that shows Sun Oh&#39;s arcs of moving forward and slowly falling for Yuk Jo (as how Jojo experienced with Hyeyeong).<br><br>Please guys, even though your expectation about the end game was not met, we need to be open-minded, look at the bigger picture, and see the depth of this drama. This ain&#39;t all about Sun Oh and Jojo, it&#39;s all about true love on the right time with effort, healing, and sincere decision. If you guys just gave the drama low ratings or disliked it on Netflix just because Sun Oh and Jojo did not end up together, that&#39;s too unreasonable. Please, appreciate the effort of its webtoon author, the production team, and Netflix. This really is a great drama with a deep lesson. All I could say negatively is that it&#39;s rushed and there are some characters that didn&#39;t have much significance in the story.
