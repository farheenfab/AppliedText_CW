I don’t understand why y’all say like you regret watching it and hate that jojo ends up with hye yeong!! THEY ARE  OBVIOUSLY SOOO MEANT TO BE !!!😭❤️ the fact that hye yeong waited so long just to be with her and being such a selfless man is just enough for the whole series to be perfect he had such a good understanding of her unlike sun oh! What jojo and hye yeong has is so pure😭Damn it y’al! Everyone who’s hating on that prolly doesnt even know what true love is.
