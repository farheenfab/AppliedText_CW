I love the ending it was the best for the characters.<br><br>I like Yukjo for Sunoh more than Jojo.<br><br>Cause he will never be happy with Jojo. <br>Jojo and Sunoh are two scarred souls that will only hurt each other eventually. <br>They need people like Hye yeong and Yujko. <br>People who loves unconditionally and unselfishly. They have so much love to give for Jojo and Sunoh.<br><br>Unlike Jojo and Sunoh who needs to fix their own self first. They can&#39;t give the love that each other deserves.<br> A love that is so pure you don&#39;t need an app to know that it&#39;s there.<br>Imagine if Jojo&#39;s alarm did not ring back then or Sunoh&#39; alarm. I don&#39;t think they will continue to pursue each other.<br>They rely on love alarm for their feelings.<br><br>But Yukjo and Hye yeong rely on the love they can give to Sunoh and Jojo more.☺️<br><br>Not love alarm as a gauge to their feelings but the feeling Sunoh and Jojo gave them.
