I screamed when Jojo chose to ring Hye Yeong&#39;s alarm. The chemistry between Jojo and Sun Oh is so strong. I&#39;m so disappointed. Somewhere in between, it felt like the lead girl was just playing with the guys&#39; feelings. Don&#39;t watch season 2 if you&#39;re shipping Sun-oh and Jojo.<br>For those who watched this and were hoping to have Sun-oh and Jojo together, same. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
