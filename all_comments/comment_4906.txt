With all the Spoilers coming out,  it was really frustrating. And it frustrated me more that she didn&#39;t end up with Sun-Oh.  Hye Yeong and Jojo don&#39;t have chemistry at all.  Nothing. It would be easier to accept had it been another actor played Hye Yeong&#39;s part.  Like Yook Sungjae.  Then I wouldn&#39;t have to be heartbroken as af.
