Tbh I think one of the reasons why I didn&#39;t really warm up to the idea of them (Hye-Yeong and Jojo ) together is because everything felt forced on her end and they didn&#39;t rlly have much chemistry... if there had been more development there prolly I would&#39;ve been all happy with it...<br>Like even here there was no guarantee for me that these were her legitimate feelings and just I felt she just wanted to show Hye-Yeong she was trying<br>In the end I just wanted Sun-oh to heal and be happy...not necessarily with her but in general cuz boyy did she mess him up<br>I&#39;m happy that she&#39;s happy tho and I hope eventually Sun-oh rings Yuk-jo&#39;s alarm because she cares for him so much and they understand each other&#39;s worlds betterðŸ’•
