I&#39;m not ready for another heartbreak. Sun Oh is a sweetest guy ever. He doesnt deserve to be treated like that. I understand that Hye-yong also deserves her but what Kim Jojo did to Sun Oh is the most hurtful things in the drama. Sun Oh suffered just figuring out what was the main reason why Kim Jojo breaking up with him and hoping that someday Kim jojo will ring his love alarm again. Why kim jojo can&#39;t even tell? I&#39;m so annoyed. I am really a Team Sun Oh from the beginning and after this trailer I am now for sure that Hye-yong gonna be with her. Still, I am rooting for him with Jojo. They still love each other then why they don&#39;t start again by not relying on love alarm, instead  their eyes and heart? <br><br>Poor Sun Oh ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ˜¥
