If Netflix makes the mistake of ending at a cliffhanger and renewing Love Alarm for S3, I won&#39;t waste my time to watch something which can easily end, Idc how good it is. Please whoever Jojo wants to choose, she should just choose in S2 and let&#39;s get it over and done with. It&#39;s too hectic and nerve wracking waiting for a long time to know the ending of a drama which makes zero sense to be dragged. It&#39;s not like it hasn&#39;t been done before, True Beauty drama ended before the webtoon. If they do that, I hope people lose interest and forget about itðŸ˜‚.<br> Now Sunjo shippers have started fighting for a season 3 because they are scared the drama would have a Hyejo endingðŸ˜‚. If Netflix doesn&#39;t end it at S2, it means we&#39;ll have to wait for another 2 years for another season automatically cause Jang Ga Ram is serving in the military at the moment. I honestly can&#39;t wait for another 2 years for a drama which doesn&#39;t need to be dragged that far when a girl simply makes a choice of who she lovesðŸ˜‚. If they don&#39;t end at S2, that&#39;s it for me, I would lose interest in it and just forget about itðŸ˜‚. Like True Beauty ended when the webtoon hadn&#39;t ended, Love Alarm can do same. I can&#39;t believe people are saying True Beauty should have a S2, for what? There&#39;s no need, they ended it well. There are some dramas out there which are in need of a proper ending and writers are refusing to give it that, eg. Scarlet Heart whilst others which can simply end, fans are fighting for other seasons cause they can&#39;t accept an ending which either way it goes, it won&#39;t be a bad ending either.
