Its 2023 already but cant get over with these two, the reason why millions have demanded to have a season 2 is to see them a happy ending but ended up nothing again. Hope they will have another netflix romcom on thier own. They have a perfect blend of chemistry specially song kang is like a bad boy and kim so hyun is like an angel, opposite really creates a magnifying electric chemistry😅❤
