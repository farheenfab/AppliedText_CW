We literally waited a whole year....I was very eager to see sun ho and jojo together...in first season I used to cry in each episode by seeing their love for each other...whenever jojo felt lonely there was only one person by her side and it was sun ho....if hye Yong really liked jojo he should have told it to sun ho....sun ho literally asked thousand times...but still he didn&#39;t accept it...and on other hand jojo...if you love someone u will never leave their side...jojo even said she cannot love anyone more than sun oh...then yyyy.....y did you choose hye Yong over sun oh...he pleaded her...but still...I miss season 1....season 2 was boring,cringe and hurtful...sometimes I think these both are 2 different dramas....i wanted just one thing just one....sun ho... ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
