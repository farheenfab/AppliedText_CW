tbh jojo&#39;s character is really toxic to me she only care for herself and her feelings only! she never realised how much she had hurt them while hurting her ownself  she was first in a relationship where she never loved her boyfriend then when sun oh appeared she kissed him and cheated on her boyfriend and then left him for sun oh.. when she got all love and care from sun oh she left him just to protect herself from getting hurt emotionally again like her past and then suddenly after four years she started dating with hye yeong like what the helllll...when he tried to kiss her she got scared ??? and when sun oh tried to kiss her she didn&#39;t moved a bit like whattttt she never thought of hye yeong at that time like ?? <br>if there will be any season again i know she will gonna leave hye yeong for another boy ðŸ’€<br>and if you guys will say she was lonely from her childhood she suffered alot  DUDE EVERY PERSON HAD SUFFERED!! SUN OH TOO HYE YEONG TOO AND EVERY ONE HAVE PROBLEMS IN THEIR LIFE !!!!!
