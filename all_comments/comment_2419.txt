I loved jojo so damn much in s1 and was still loving her some times ago but after watching the s2,i think director potrayed her role as a selfish person who left the person who gave her a reason to live and to be happy and stole someone&#39;s happiness!!<br>I really didnt like the ending!!<br>I feel shame on myself because i waited two years for this shitty ending!!<br>Hyeyong and sunoh deserves her but jojo dont deserve any of these twoo!!
