Tbh, when u first dating someone like for almost 1 day meet. You cannot easily move on like clap your hand. I know what sunoh felt. Eventho his character like tht. But, i feel bad for him. Ride a motorcycle with your girl and got into an accident and after tht your girl suddenly want to breakup and ignore you totally worst. I know sunoh is hyeyong friend. But the thing is jojo you actually hurting these two man’s feelings eventho u didn’t mean to. First sunoh you just left him out of cold without single right reason you said “im bored”. And then hyeyong come along be friend with you ... ting ting ting... waiting for you like forever, and still you didn’t ring the alarm mybe open your heart yet. Jojo you can go single and find what you want and what you really worth for ☺️❤️❤️ thnks
