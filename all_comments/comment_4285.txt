The cast had potential but writers didn&#39;t. It is a complete &#39;Disappointment&#39;! Not a single character is defined properly, everything is just messed up in the story. I feel sorry for Song Kang, I hope to see him soon in some sensible show. Don&#39;t put your time in it, 1 season was okay but this one is just frustating..
