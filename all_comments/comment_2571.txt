Don’t know why people thing Sun Oh is a bad guy here, he never treated her badly. He went for her the moment he liked her not like mister stalker who basically stalker at the begging even started to work at the same place. Sun Oh was confuse what happened and ti be faire I am still confused. They had an accident and she just decided to push him ?!? Without any explanation it was really heartless of her part. And then she loved him and made her not loved him and fall in love in the other guy, which i simply do not understand why? None of the guys were bad, just don’t understand what was her problem
