&quot;I did not hate you, it is just because you&#39;re too heavy&quot; - Kim Jojo, 2021<br><br>It takes maturity to understand the beauty and message of the story. We don&#39;t always end up with our first love, do we? No matter how much this two people love each other, they can&#39;t stay together if it&#39;s &quot;heavy&quot;, it&#39;s just really hard to force. They won&#39;t be truly happy because of the weight. We all deserve to find the love that is meant for us, a love so smooth that truly makes us happy. Love Alarm 2 relayed that message perfectly. ❤️<br>- CCTO
