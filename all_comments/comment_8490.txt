Seriously,  hye young is the best match for Jojo. Both economically and mentally. I don&#39;t need another drama where the rich in law threatening female lead, sun oh mom seems like one. Second of all both hye young and jojo is selfless and not immature. Sun oh knew that his best frnd liked jojo but still he went for it and hye young remained silent. When finally hye young got a chance with her, sun oh got pretty mad at him and called him a gold digger. Jojo seems to start liking hye young and is giving him a chance. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamhyeyoung">#teamhyeyoung</a> 4ever ‚ù§
