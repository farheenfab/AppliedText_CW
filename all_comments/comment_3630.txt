Well I don&#39;t like how the story ended, I don&#39;t hate hye yeong but I think Sun Oh deserves an explanation about what happened. He was lost and assumed things had ended that way. Sun Oh is not a bad person tbh, He&#39;s longing for love and jojo gave her a new perspective in life then suddenly Jojo left him hanging. After how many years, She still loved jojo. Idk I feel bad for Sun Oh. Sad ending but it was a great series.
