Let me rant real quick. I’m team hye yeong 😅🙊 but hear me out. Hye yeong liked jojo but didn’t make a move on her because she had a boyfriend at the time and respected her and sun oh KNEW that hye yeong liked jojo even<br>if he didn’t admit it and STILL went  after Jojo (he barely knew who she was) and basically stole her away. Like sun oh just popped up out nowhere and so did their relationship and I feel like they had 0 chemistry. Maybe because of the acting or the characters just weren’t compatible but yeah. And I do feel bad for sun oh because jojo broke his heart and is now only gonna try for hye yeong and not him. I’m done ✌🏾
