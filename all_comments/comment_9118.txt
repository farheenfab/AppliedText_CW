Here is my theory according to the trailer<br>1- at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=7">0:07</a> jojo&#39;s love alarm rings for one of the boys, and seeing the fancy shoes it&#39;s probably SUNOH BUT I DON&#39;T WANNA HOPE<br>2- when jojo says you fool how can you not get mad, it&#39;s prob bc Hyeyong knows she kissed sunoh<br>3- sunoh being so damn arrogant is prob gonna end up bad for him ( thanks netflix)<br>4- when hyeyong says I&#39;ll wait for you it&#39;s prob bc she tells him she still has feelings for sunoh<br>5- jojo ends up with hyeyong and drops the love alarm shit, even tho if she still use it it would tell her IT&#39;S SUNOH
