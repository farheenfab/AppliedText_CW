I just canâ€™t accept the fact that Iâ€™ve waited for this season 2 to happen just to find out that jojoâ€™s not gonna end up with sun oh ðŸ¥º <br><br>People be telling sun ohâ€™s just another pretty boy who has a lot of money and has a lot of issues. Noo, jojo left him hanging without any explanation after the accident. Itâ€™s just painful to see him not moving on from the pain then after many years him to just see jojo with his bestfriend. Sun ohâ€™s character deserves justice too ðŸ¥º Lol im way too serious about this. Im just team Sun oh ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
