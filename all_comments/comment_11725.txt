I want to see Sun Oh and Jojo happy together. Really! Cause it was my wish since 2019 when I first watched this drama. But, really I-I also can&#39;t see Hye Yeong suffering because of that - and vice versa for Sun Oh (especially this human! I can&#39;t see Sun Oh hurt the most) if Hye Yeong with Jojo. Omg, I&#39;m so confused :( I know I&#39;m not Jojo. But this drama really makes me unable to choose between the two of themâ€”Sun Oh or Hye Yeong:( Which one?
