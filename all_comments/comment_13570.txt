Hye-young and Jojo , they&#39;re the best team up for me. It does not a strong feeling that Sun-oh felt for Jojo or vice vers, because it felt like they&#39;re just understanding each other. Yung nakaka relate lang sila , it might be a pity or ewan. Kase nga galing si sun-oh sa family that so focused in their lifestyle wealth. Ahh basta HYE-YOUNG and JOJO pleaseee
