I just get the weird feeling that Sun Oh is obsessed with her while Hyeyoung loves her. Love doesn’t always mean possession or liking someone back. Hyeyoung waited until after she broke up with her first boyfriend and years after she broke up with Sun Oh to tell her how he feels. He didn’t even download love alarm to prevent complicating her relationship with Sun Oh. Hyeyoung doesn’t even expect her to love him back and said that he is okay even if she dumps him. That’s real love while Sun Oh tried to push himself on her while high key stalking her even after they broke up. He even stole her from her first boyfriend while knowing Hyeyoung likes her. My opinion is that Sun Oh and Jojo are too broken for each other. They need love from stable people like Hyeyoung and Yukjo to grow. I think their love was a strong first love that still lingers like any serious relationship but I don’t think they should end up together. Just my 2 cents.
