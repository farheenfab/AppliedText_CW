Sun Oh is very good looking and I am not surprised why a lot of people wanted him to be the endgame. However, this show is more than just high school love story. It is about growth. How people grow mature in love. When we are so young and broken, we can make wrong decisions and may hurt others. But it is all about healing. I reality, first loves always have a place in our hearts, but we never end up with them. Because we grow and realize that we want something else. I think that is the message of this drama that most people failed to see.
