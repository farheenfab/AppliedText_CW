I just don’t get one thing. This guy straight up went for the girl his bestfriend obviously likes, so why do people want him to get the girl in the end? He didn’t “accidentally” fall for the girl but kissed her and suddenly he was all interested in her when he was sure his friend liked this girl. I think these two have great chemistry but I can’t ship them in this drama for this reason. And the fact that he gets upset when his friend tries to go for the girl a few years later? Double standard much?
