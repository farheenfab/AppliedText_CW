I think that it&#39;s obvious that she has feelings for Sunoh only, she wants to have feelings foe Hye-young.<br>I&#39;m so mad right now at the writers because Hyeyoung is the perfect guy, he is so considerate, lovable and handsome... Where is Danoh let&#39;s curse at the writers togheter. I&#39;ve waited so much for this? The good guy won&#39;t have his beautiful end. Sunoh still has a bad character, sorry I still don&#39;t like him.
