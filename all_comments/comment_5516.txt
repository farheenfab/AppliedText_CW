The ending was pretty realistic. It&#39;s y&#39;all not accepting it. Jojo moved on from her first love, even sun oh got a pretty, kind gf who cared for her. If y&#39;all still not satisfied go watch other dramas . There&#39;s still plenty of dramas where first love wins. Go stick with your usual cliche dramas where the rich, handsome, popular guy with family issues end with the poor girl. Srsly aren&#39;t y&#39;all tired of it? ðŸ™ƒ
