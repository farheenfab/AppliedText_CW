I really hate how she puts effort to not break Hye-yeongs heart while crashing Sun-oh. She left him without explanation Sun-oh continued to love her even though it hurts and this is what he gets in return. Sun-oh deserves better. Gurl u love sun oh and he likes u back even though all the ridiculous things u have done. So whats the problem just go back to Sun-oh. imma cry for real poor boy.
