<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKIIrALIFOY&amp;t=51">0:51</a> its moments like this that really make me dislike Sun-ho. <br><br><br><br><br>He just couldn&#39;t take no for an answer. While its undestandable that he&#39;s frustrated...<br><br>Everytime he was given an answer he didn&#39;t like or wasn&#39;t <b>i love you</b> he either grabbed her <b>to knock some sense into her</b> or just randomly kissed her to <b>Snap her out of it</b> and don&#39;t forget the good&#39;ol <b>Why don&#39;t i just scream at you to the top of my lungs to get you to realise that you like me</b> its just unbelievable how UN-SELF-AWARE Sunho was being in regards to respecting her boundaries. To me its Sun-ho who&#39;s more selfish in this scene.<br><br>I know MANY are callling Jojo selfish in this scene...<br><br>But to me it&#39;s abundantly clear to me that BOTH of them are being incredibly selfish. They both have their reasons to be acting the way they are. I just happen to sympathize with Jojo alot more<br><br>The reason Jojo doesn&#39;t give him a reason is because the truth of their breakup largely involves her trauma where she endured as a kid growing up having survived a mass suicide weighing down on her...along with emotional abuse from her cousin and aunt coupled with the weight that would come from loving Sun-ho <b>And couple all that with Sun-ho repeatedly forcing her into uncomfortable situations like this</b> and <b>NO ONE</b> i repeat <b>NO ONE</b> is entitled to know someone elses trauma. She doesn&#39;t even tell Hye-yeong about her trauma (Although he secretly knew already in S1) but hye-yeong could already tell by then that she was damaged and needed space which is WHY HE WAS SO PATIENT. Hye-yeong understood that there was a deep pain in Jojo and it wasn&#39;t going to go away just by forcing it.<br><br>So its incredibly frustrating that Sun-ho is just Bulldozing ahead with such force to find the truth when he isn&#39;t entitled to know such things...but also Sun-ho&#39;s upbringing perfectly explains WHY he is so blinded by his own insecurities and continues to cross boundaries without knowing.<br><br>For Sun-ho, his reasons for being so unwilling to accept a no is because of his own trauma in his upbringing. Sun-ho CRAVES validation because he feels that no one has ever truly loved him and thus has MASSIVE insecurity problems. So now that the app has provided assured love...it takes away his insecurity ....now that it was taken from him by Jojo for her own reasons...he can&#39;t accept it when before it was all fine. He doesn&#39;t have enough hindsight to realise that her reason must&#39;ve been serious. Sun-ho can only then focus on HIS feelings. But he also doesn&#39;t understand that he continually crosses MAJOR boundaries.<br><br>But even after all that i still on Jojo&#39;s side. Even understanding Sun-ho&#39;s frustration....he&#39;s literally just forcing her into these situations without once thinking what its doing to Jojo.<br><br>I think what Jojo says about <b>You were the reason i installed the shield but Hye-yeong makes me want to remove it</b> that&#39;s the most perfect way to describe Jojo&#39;s headspace...<br><br>Jojo was finally ready to <b>GIVE</b> love. And Sun-ho couldn&#39;t accept that the love she was giving out just wasn&#39;t for him.
