So stupid. I dont see any reason why she should like hye-yeong. I mean, wasn&#39;t she in love with sun-oh this whole time? But she&#39;s not opening up to him, instead she&#39;s opening up to another man. Does that even make sense? He didn&#39;t even do anything wrong. And now, she&#39;s like, who do I like? Well that&#39;s for you to figure out, woman.
