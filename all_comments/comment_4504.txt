F*ck season2 of love alarm, season 1 was good i watched it, but really the girl just played with there hearts and she knows that she likes the first main character not the best friend, and still ended up with best friend, the best friend literally just stalked her in season 1 and didn&#39;t even spoke up to her. the girl  broke the main characters heart all she has to do is apologize, its not hard. fuck her not the befriend and the main character, just f*ck  her. CHANGE IT NOW, OR GIVE US SEASON 3.  no offense the girl is manipulative  in season 2. i feel bad for the main character cause he was alone and his bestfriend just left him for the girl, like wtf. bye. one more time there better be season 3 and no i&#39;m not waiting for 2023, and if season 3 is trash i&#39;m throwing the whole show away, im disliking it for now on I&#39;m depending on sweet home. just so you know WE HAD HIGH HOPES BUT ITS RUINED SO NOW ITS THUMBS DOWN.
