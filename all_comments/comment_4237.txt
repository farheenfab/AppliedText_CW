Very underwhelming and disappointing. Season 2 just felt like filler episodes that did nothing to contribute to the original plot. We have a female lead who is so confused about who she likes that she needs an app to confirm her feelings, we have two male leads that are so poorly treated and thrown around the bush, we have questions in which was never answered, we have empty scenes of nothing but walking and staring, and well everything was just so twisted!<br><br>You don’t even need to watch season 2 to get your answers checked because you won’t get them. I’m sorry, but it’s not even about sun-oh not ending up with jojo (which did hurt me a lot to be honest), it’s just about how so poorly written the second season was. We waited 2 years for this type of ending and I am not satisfied in the slightest. I’m sorry but the two male leads deserve better (and why the hell was their friendship ruined all because of some girl?)
