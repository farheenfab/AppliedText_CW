I don’t really understand why pipol prefer sun oh over hye yeong (it means maybe they don’t understand what love is).. hye yeong has everything you could ask for i mean sweet , genuine, understanding, not rude , a perfect example of a best boy! And his love for jojo is not based on love alarm , even with or without that he genuinely love Jojo and patiently wait for her. And that’s true and mature love. And in reality we all want someone like Hye yeong. <br><br>Im really happy for Jojo - Hye yeong endgame. :)))))
