The one thing about this drama that i absolutely admire is its bravery NOT to go down the typical Kdrama path. <br><br><br><br><br>Although i haven&#39;t seen many Kdramas... at this point in the show i could sort of tell that if this were to go down the typical path we&#39;ve all seen before...this would&#39;ve been the scene to change her mind and go with Sun-ho. Sun-ho&#39;s lines about &quot;Your eyes don&#39;t lie&quot; really had <b>End game vibes</b> so i was like omg here we go Sun-ho is endgame. As a Hye-yeong shipper myself i was DREADING this because i thought it was going down the typical road of <b>well the main lead said something really smoothe so i guess he&#39;s the one</b> type of roadðŸ˜‚<br><br>BUT NO<br><br>Ironically, this is the scene that solidified her feelings for Hye-yeong because thats all she could think about. I love that the writers recognised that forcing something doesn&#39;t work...especially with a person like Jojo who&#39;s been tortured her whole life. She&#39;s spent her whole life being <b>Forced</b> And I absolutely love how they took my expectations of this scene and flipped it on its head and injected actual honest to god realism and character consistency.<br><br>At this point of the show Jojo was being completely selfish (Righfully so) she broke up with Sun-ho to spare her feelings and shut off her love alarm to everyone.<br><br>Ironically Sun-oh was the one that got her to think of something other than herself for once because of that kiss. I think she realised that she finally put someone before herself... in that she couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Hye-yeong when Sun-ho forced a kiss. I think at that point she realised how much she&#39;d changed because of Hye-yeong.<br><br>I just love how they took her actual character traits and themes and brought them out so realistically and made them consistent and didn&#39;t just change her character because the main lead said something sweet and kissed her because realistically a kiss obviously doesn&#39;t just heal scars and I&#39;m SO GLAD the writer didn&#39;t write that <b>A kiss healed her</b> or some stupid shit like that.<br><br>I love that the writers acknowledged that <b>Chemistry alone should not deteremine who people should be with</b> and for me personally i can admit that Sun-oh and Jojo have better romantic Chemistry...but things that make your heart beat really fast isn&#39;t the only thing people need in a relationship and i think that writers did a fantastic job illistrating that while Sun-ho and Jojo may have had mad Chemistry...thats about all they had...what Hye-yeong gave her will last alot longer because he gives her everything else.<br><br>(When i say main lead I&#39;m talking about Sun-oh. I know Sun-oh isn&#39;t the main lead in S2 but i don&#39;t care I&#39;ll ALWAYS see Hye-yeong as the 2nd lead and Sun-oh as the Main Lead...and plus thinking of Hye-yeong as a 2nd lead REALLY takes the weight off of my heartbreak for other 2nd leads because in my mind this is a 2nd lead that finally got the girl)
