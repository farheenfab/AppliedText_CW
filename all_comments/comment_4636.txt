READ WEBTOON! Everyone whoâ€™s hating on sunoh rn bec of how he acted in S2, please read the webtoon. Thereâ€™s so many scenes that are in the drama but wasnâ€™t in the webtoon. (Check @/vailerra on twt, they post about the differences)<br><br>Sunoh in this season was portrayed so differently from his more developed and mature character in the webtoon. In the webtoon, he found a way to remove the shield which is to give it to someone else to which he offers jojo to give it to him even if itâ€™ll make him go thru the same pain with the condition that she genuinely rings Hyeyeongâ€™s alarm so that he can make peace with his feelings and give up.<br><br>Jojo refused to give it to him but in the end Sunoh took the shield and spear to ring yukjoâ€™s alarm and to take the burden away from jojo so that she could live happily with hyeyeong ðŸ¥º
