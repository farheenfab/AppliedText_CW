I Love this couple... Sun oh was her first love, intense and inmature it last less than a 50 days, but It kind of bothers me that Sun Oh was so selfish since season 1 , I wasn&#39;t going to watch this drama because I remember being so angry at Sun Oh knowing his best friends feeling&#39;s towards Jojo and still approaching her, if Jojo and Sun Oh would have still being together it would have been a toxic relationship where they were the escaping door to all their problems..Then after 4 years Sun Oh hasn&#39;t forgotten Jojo, not because he still loved her, but because he was kinda obsessed with her ... But with hye yeong it was a mature love, he was always kind, mature, patient, he truly loved Jojo from the beginning to the end... I loved S2
