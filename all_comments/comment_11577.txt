Can the Hye-young fans please stop hating on Sun-oh? And can the Sun-oh fans please stop hating on Hye-young? And on Jojo as well. This is supposed to be a story, not a debate. Each character has gone through their own fair share of pain and growth. Can we just support and hope that it doesn&#39;t end in tears? Like let&#39;s calm down a bit please because I&#39;m getting scared about how aggressive y&#39;all are becoming.
