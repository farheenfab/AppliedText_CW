The fact that Love Alarm and My First First Love are barely similar for having 2 seasons each and they&#39;re Netflix productions, I think in Love Alarm, Jojo will end up with Hye-young even tho Jojo and SunOh dated just like in My First First Love, Song-i ended up with Tae-o even she and Do-Hyun dated and loved each other.<br>ps: sorry for dragging a different drama here.
