I thought it would be better if I re-watch season 1 then continue watching season 2 (when it&#39;s released of course!). &quot;Love Alarm&quot; is one of my favorite Korean dramas. However, the episodes were very few and it made me feel really sad. So, yup! I will re-watch season 1 until season 2 is released to completion. Is there the same?
