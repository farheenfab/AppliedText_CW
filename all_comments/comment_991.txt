The intensity this scene had can make anything watch it uncountable no.of times..the dialogue delivery,,the expressions are just awesome!!!!! I like the other male lead anybody will be happy to get him as partner but his chemistry with JoJo is not that much,,there is no such passion and intensity.may be we would have seen that intensity between them as well if he would have been casted as SunOh I guess.
