I don&#39;t know why people didn&#39;t like this just because she is not with the second lead but hye young(main lead) deserve her, his love towards her without any condition is just indescribable. And the whole drama and the whole story (from portraying character to making it meaningful) is just wow. I&#39;m in love with this drama, I don&#39;t know how many times I cried as well as smile at the same time watching this drama. i can watch this drama again and again.
