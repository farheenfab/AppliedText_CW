I love how different the drama&#39;s version and webtoon are, but ultimately the same. In the webtoon, the first time Jojo rang Hyeyoung&#39;s alarm was when they (Hyeyoung, Jojo, Sunoh, and Yukjo) had a planned confrontation to see who Jojo really loves in the present. I kinda wish the drama showed Sunoh ringing Yukjo&#39;s alarm though. In the planned confrontation, Jojo&#39;s alarm had only 1 person ringing it and it was Hyeyoung because Sunoh is ringing Yukjo&#39;s love alarm at that point. Sunoh learned to love Yukjo. AHHH the feels for both couples are lovely!!!
