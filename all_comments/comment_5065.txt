SPOLIER DO NOT READ IF YOU DIDN&#39;T FINISH SEASON 2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m honestly so pissed like I really wanted Jojo to be with Sun-oh or to end up with no one and work on herself and her trauma instead of trying to be with a man. I tried really hard to like her with the other guy but it just doesn&#39;t fit. Pretty upset about season 2 since I&#39;ve been waiting for ages for it.
