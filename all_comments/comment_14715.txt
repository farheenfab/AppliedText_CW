I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll end up seeing it, it looks very predictable with phrases like &quot;I could wait for you&quot; or &quot;you fool, aren&#39;t you mad?&quot;, those phrases are the typical ones that are said between those who end up together in the story, and I hoped they would make her stay with the other boy, with whom she fell in love first. I thought they would have more value and change the ending of the webtoon, but everything points to no, for the end to be like this, the first season is enough for me.
