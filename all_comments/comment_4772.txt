Ugh I was just disgusted with how Sun-Oh basically went out of his way to get the girl his best friend liked (but couldn’t do anything because of her boyfriend) and even kissed another boyfriend’s girl. TALK ABOUT HOME WRECKER. Hye-yeong respected all of that, her space, her boyfriend, her hardwork, her dorkiness/cuteness. Sun-oh’s scenes were cute, but goddamn was his feelings out of the blue. You can’t even see WHY he likes her. With Hye-yeong you can see CLEARLY why. Hye-yeong is just so sincere, so self-less, so respectful.. I’m utterly in love with his character ugh. If this doesn’t end with him, I’m swearing off all korean dramas together. Because ending up with a home wrecker is just so disgusting, that’s the farthest K-Dramas will take me. I’m going down with this ship.
