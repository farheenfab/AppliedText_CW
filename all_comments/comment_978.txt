Well, in the ending of love alarm, ep. 8; Jojo went to the opening of Love alarm 2.0 because he remembered what Guk du told her about the shield, only the developer can remove the shield, since the developer was in the event, she tried to reach onto him not knowing that she will bump into Sun oh and Yuk jo, then Jojo accidentally let Sun oh in the 10m radius, then Hye yeong, trying to protect her, step in the 10m radius. That&#39;s the time Yuk jo knew that only Jojo will have the chance for Sun oh to ring his alarm.<br>She wanted the shield to be deactivated from her alarm, just so she could confess everything to Sun oh and to tell him that she still love him. Remember when Gul mi is having a trial for her online shop, when Jojo delivers her snack, when Gul mi removes the app on her screen she saw the wallpaper, it&#39;s Yuk jo, and Gul mi suddenly said, &quot;I&#39;m sure you know her, she&#39;s hwang sun oh&#39;s girlfriend&quot;, but then Jojo became sensitive about the topic Gul mi is dropping because he still loves Sun oh.<br><br>I really want them to be together in the end, because, seriously, they have the spark, man. Season 2 is coming let&#39;s wait for it.
