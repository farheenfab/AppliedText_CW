We can do nothing but leave it for Jojo’s heart to decide. If she doesn’t end up with Sun Oh just please mend back his broken heart, he deserves an explanation and a chance to understand the reason why they broke up so he can get a closure and move on for good. Only then he can finally let her go. <br><br>And if she does not ended up with Hye Yeong, please make him genuinely happy without having to stand in front of a mirror and fake a smile. He deserves someone who loves him as much as he loves them. He deserves to receive pure genuine love like he has been giving freely.
