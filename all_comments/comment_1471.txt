Ok if he wasnt attractive everything would immediately turn creepy. And maybe it&#39;s just me I didnt enjoy this as much as I hope because despite their attractions towards each other, jojo was still cheating on her boyfriend, sun oh is making a move towards a girl he know his cousin/friend likes. And the way everything was executed was so stalkery I dont know to feel about it. And before y&#39;all commenting that no one is forcing me to watch it if I dont like it, i do like the show. It&#39;s just these bits that makes it less enjoyable. And the actors are super cute.
