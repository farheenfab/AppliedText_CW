istg if she ends up with sun-oh, i&#39;ll be so mad. first of all, i hate how he knows that hyeyeong likes jojo yet he kisses her after seeing her for 1 day??? and she had a boyfriend that time??? i hate his character. i&#39;m so baffled that everyone wants jojo to end up with him... really shows how superficial you all are. i see some people in the comments saying that hyeyeong should&#39;ve &quot;manned up and confessed&quot; but why the fuck would he do that when SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND. best boy didn&#39;t want to be a homewrecker. tbh jojo should just be clear about her feelings. it&#39;s so frustrating to see her just run away from her problems.
