Team Sunoh no matter what! Song Kang fighting!!!<br><br>I&#39;d probably see the last ep first then go back to s1 if I don&#39;t like s2 ending ðŸ¤£<br><br>We are not hating on Hyehyeong but the man didn&#39;t do anything in s1. Jojo didn&#39;t even know him even if they are on the same school and same part time job. And Sunoh didn&#39;t do anything bad to Jojo, why did she have to breakup with the poor guy?
