I just finish watching both of the seasons together and honestly I regret why I watched season 2 I can&#39;t believe the ending... I wanted to know what Sun oh &#39;s fault in all of this... Jojo did so wrong  with him .....Hey yang was a very nice guy....He deseved to be loved...but we want to see friendship with jojo not love angle which is not at all suiting them... Even Last 10 min i was hoping that Sun oh and jojo will come together but they didn&#39;t.. <br>Seems like I have to watch season 1 again just to see their connection   so I can feel much better this just pissing me offff....
