NO!! Pls I want Jojo to end up with Hye Young. I know most people are shipping Jojo with Sun-oh but I feel like it was selfish on his part to pursue his bestfriend&#39;s crush. Hye Young was the only one who actually cared about his bestfriend&#39;s and Jojo&#39;s feelings. He&#39;s so selfless. My baby deserves to be happyü§ß‚ù§Ô∏è
