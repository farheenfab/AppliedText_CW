actually at the start of the episode of LA s1 i wanted Hye Yeong to end up with JoJo but i wasn&#39;t hoping bcos i was thinking Sun Oh would definitely be meant to Jojo BUT LA fooled me at the last part of episodes it gave me glimpse of hope that all along Hyeong ended up with JoJo. I couldn&#39;t stop giggling and smiling.. my heart really flattered when in the end of episode Yeong n Jojo ended up together I didn&#39;t expect that i thought it was never for them yet the happy ending favored to Hyeong n Jojo even in the season 2 .. what a double jackpot i must say LA is my 3rd Fave ever kdrama.. 진짜!
