No one can deny how good HyeYoung&#39;s love is for JoJo but no one can also deny how much JoJo and SunOh love each other despite all that has happened. I&#39;ll just sit back, relax, and enjoy this when it&#39;s out. I won&#39;t stress myself if she won&#39;t end up with the one I&#39;m rooting for. I can always have my ideal happy ending in my imagination. Love Alarm has somehow taught me many lessons and I&#39;m so looking forward for this second season. Thank you Netflix!
