Team Hye-young all the way!!!<br><br>He is the exact type of person you would want as a partner. He is kind, nice, mature, patient, EMOTIONALLY STABLE, a good friend and the most selfless character. He does not magically try to fix every problem Jojo has, but he stays by her side helping her even when he is not loved back. Just because he is the lead that doesn&#39;t mean he has to be overlooked. Although i still think the best choice would be for Jojo to take care of herself not relying on any of them in a romantic aspect, she needs to mature and grow up as a person. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamhyeyoung">#teamhyeyoung</a>
