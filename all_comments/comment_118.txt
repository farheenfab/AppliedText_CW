The chemistry between sun oh &amp; jojo was so good, we can see the love between them whenever their eyes meet. Suddenly a lame reason to break up. Finally She ended up with hye yeong but I don&#39;t see any love or spark between them. It looks like forced love ending. I was not able to watch season 2 epi 4,5&amp; 6. I had a huge hope that she will end up with sun oh. Atleast the director/ writter should have convinced us by creating proper reason for break up with sun oh &amp; end up with hye yeong. Biggest disappointment. I hated the character jojo.<br><br>PS: I love love love song kang ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
