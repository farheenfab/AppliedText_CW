I heard that she ends up with hyeyeong in the webtoon but Iâ€™m rlly hoping for the writers to change the ending and have her end up Sunoh (alternate endings so that itâ€™s more entertaining and we can have both endings for both ships// kind of like Itaewon class and how although it had the same ending, the writer chose to revise/ rewrite some parts) <br><br>Although hyeyeong was the first to like her, he chose to hold back and thus jojo was taken from him by sunoh. Also, Keeping Sunohâ€™s background in mind of his parents not rlly being there for him and being strict, he matches Jojo the best because with her, he became someone who she could rely on and feel comfortable with as she recovers from her trauma and same for her for him. Hyeoyeong is precious but he has a loving mom with him and a relatively good life. <br>It hurts to see Sunoh get broken like how he did after all thatâ€™s heâ€™s gone through and done for her. Also how heâ€™s acting with his new gf when he still likes Jojo. ðŸ¥º
