Undoubtedly the worst Corean TV-Series of the approx. 20 seen so far. The theme of the film is certainly very superficial. With his self-centered charakter, bossy and arrogant Sun-Ho took advantage of Jojo&#39;s weakness, making the lives of 3 people sad. On the other hand, Hye-Joung who sacrificed himself solely on Jojo&#39;s interests, but who in the end believed more in an App that has what the girl manifested. Finally Jojo of a unique suffering, that between the beauty of one and the goodness of the other has not been able to choose decisively and makes the lives of boths very sad.
