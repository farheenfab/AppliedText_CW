I know how the webtoon will end, but I do hope she chooses Sun-Oh in the end. I hope they don&#39;t follow the webtoon halfway and they change the ending so Jo Jo can be with Sun-Oh because I really like him,<br><br>But I also like the other dude too.<br><br><br>I really hope they make a season 2 ASAP!
