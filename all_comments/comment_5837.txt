I think y&#39;all have to take a look at the depth of the drama and the lesson it gives. Love shouldn&#39;t be based on the app and love is being developed, not spontaneous. Jojo and SunOh started their relationship abruptly and wrongly, without foundation and just relied everything on the app. Eversince Love Alarm was launched, the normal way of confessing and courting barely happen already---and that&#39;s the relationship between Hyeyeong and Jojo tries to break.
