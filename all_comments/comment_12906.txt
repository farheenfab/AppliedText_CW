I know this is a love story. But am I the only one who doesn&#39;t want her to actually end up with anyone? Maybe like a change for the meaning of the love alarm? I mean, there are different types of love and I think it&#39;s not all about relationship like gf or bf. I just want them to love and be loved, not in a way of being a couple but as friends. Cause honestly, friendship love is superior. And I think the three of them could actually work that out.
