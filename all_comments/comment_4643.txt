I was definitely team sunoh not because of the looks but because of their shared childhood tragedies. The first season showed us the genuine happiness, love and safety they found in each other which is why I rooted for them but I definitely see the logic behind her choosing Hyeyeong so I think I’ve calmed down and have learned to be okay with that end couple. However, I think that Sunoh could’ve been given a better closure. It felt so rushed and the plot could’ve been developed more thoroughly that does every character justice. (Also, we didn’t rlly get to see what happened with the friend and the dude which I was more interested in) I also think it would’ve been interesting to see the actual results if the shield was able to be taken off because you won’t be able to lie to your true feelings and it would’ve felt more authentic and easier to accept.
