I watched 2 or 3 episodes of the first season, and didn&#39;t finish it because I thought that Jojo&#39;s character hadn&#39;t a strong personality at first and that her first kiss with Sunho wasn&#39;t that striking because they just kissed like that (it felt so awkward to me) so their story didn&#39;t make any sense for me<br><br>But now watching the trailer of season 2, I can say that I want Jojo to finish with Hyeyeong even if I didn&#39;t finish S1, so maybe I&#39;ll change my opinion after finishing S1 I don&#39;t know but they make it too obvious that Jojo will end up with Sunho, when it seems like Hyeyeong deserves her more
