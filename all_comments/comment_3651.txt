I just finished watching season 1 and Season 2 today and i must say this was soooo disappointing....People are only supporting Hye young or whatever his name is because they pity him...As if they would be happy if their significant other moved on to their best friends after they break up with them...What Jojo did was cruel and disgusting...You hurt one bestfriend to date the other right infront of him without a care for his feelings ????? I feel like she didnt deserve both boys, they should have paired her up with someone else cause how you kiss two best friends please its dusgusting and lets not promote such nonsense....Those excited over the ending are as lame as the series was .. Only happy because they felt sorry for the second lead and pitied him, please even he deserved better than kim jojo smh ! Jojo didnt deserve both boys..
