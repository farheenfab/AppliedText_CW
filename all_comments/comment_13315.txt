A lot of people in the comments want jojo to end up with hyeyoung bc he’s waiting for her and all he does is like her/stay by her side. The problem I have with this is that he has no self-respect for himself. He wants to be with jojo bc he missed his opportunity before, but what he’s not realizing is that in the process he’s really degrading himself. By being loyal to jojo he’s disrespecting his own selfworth. He should be with someone that he likes and that person likes him back. Waiting for jojo on the possibility to come around...idk I don’t find that romantic. I hope I’m explaining this correctly.
