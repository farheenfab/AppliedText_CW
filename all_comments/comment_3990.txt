<b>majority of the people may support the endurance of Hye-young for Jojo, which&#39;s ok, but why Hye-young didn&#39;t tell when sunoh ask whether he loves jojo or not,I won&#39;t criticise jojo,cos I know the scars of her past pain,it takes time to heal.However,matters would have been sorted out if Hye-young had told everything to suhoh about the love</b>   💯💯🌿☘️🌸🌱🌼  . <b>it does hurts sunoh, cos his love is pure,atleast he&#39;s open unlike Hye-young who didn&#39;t tell when he was asked</b> <br> ☘️🌿   <b>I root suhoh,he really deserves jojo</b>  🙏☘️
