One is foolishly waiting for her to notice his love and one who&#39;s clueless as to what really went wrong. <br><br>The most pitiful here are the boys. They&#39;ve been constantly lead on by an indecisive girl who likes running away from problems. At least, settle your personal problems before engaging in a relationship. <br><br>For me, the most satisfying ending for S2 is for the boys to end up with someone else, not her. She doesn&#39;t deserve them.
