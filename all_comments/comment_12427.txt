Seriously y&#39;all stop hating on Jojo! She is the victim here actually. She is the one who went through the worst. She broke up with Sun-oh because of the people&#39;s thinking. She is the only female lead in love triangle who actually has a reason. Its easy to hate the female lead without knowing the whole damn story. And I don&#39;t know whom to support but I hope they all can have happy ending.
