Finally the trailer was out. The most anticipated kdrama for tis year!! Used to be a fan of song kang after watching him with Jenny BP in the same variey show but after wacthing this series I fell in love with Jung Garam character. He deserve to be happy! It kinda hurt seeing him caring, loving and having crush silently on Jojo.. He approach Jojo with manner n respect🤧❤  I really love his charachter.. Need a man like that😍 btw, I hope there is a little justice for him in this season 🤧🤧 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamhyeyeong">#teamhyeyeong</a>
