Team Hyeyoung here ðŸ¥° but regardless who she will choose...i just hope homegirl will be happy bcus she deserves it...what i like about Hyeyoung is the way he loves Jojo...he doesn&#39;t need anything to prove his love...he just know tht he loves her and he loves her without anything in return...tht kind of love is pure and rare...as for Sunoh hmm...he just seems possessive in my opinion
