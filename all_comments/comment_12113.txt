It&#39;s very obvious she&#39;s ending up with Hye yeong, this season two is giving them more screentime<br>Also, if anyone watch the trailer very you will clearly see that Hye yeong got an heart on his phone<br>Another proof in the trailer that Hye yeong is the end game is where they both held hands in somewhere like a tunnel (can&#39;t really describe the place) though they didn&#39;t show the two people&#39;s faces very well but those faces are that of Hye yeong and Kim JoJo
