This is the first time i love the ending of a drama a realistic, logic &amp; right ending she chose the right person. If u people watched it without being biased you wouldn’t write all these mean comments. <br>Btw i decided to watch it for sohyun &amp; kang but then after knowing the personality of the characters everything’s changed for me and this is why I ended enjoying season 2.<br>I’m pretty sure if song kang was hyeyeong instead of sunoh you would be cheering for this ending.
