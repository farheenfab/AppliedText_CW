I will be so angry if she ends up with sun oh. He does not deserve her at all. All of his actions haven&#39;t been genuine in the sense that something was always his motivating factor. He knew his friend liked her, yet he made a move on her. She is also so fickle. Hye yeong is the only one who genuinely loves her &amp; will do anything just for her comfort. Sny logical person in real life will choose hue yeong. Sun oh even went ahead to date someone else. I wouldn&#39;t trust a person like that with my heart. People are just so into aggressive guys &amp; feel like  the macho man has to win. It doesn&#39;t make sense. I will always choose a hyo yeong anytime any day over a sun oh.
