We must remember that hye yeong smoked and I do not think that it favors his health and in the first season he had to confess his feelings before sun-ho did, but even so he did not do it for the sake of jojo, but in the future if jojo she stays with hye yeong I think she will suffer since he may not stop smoking since almost no one can quit an addiction and cigarettes is one of them, and she will suffer for hye yeong&#39;s health, well I hope jojo stays with sun ho.
