I honestly wanted to like this drama but it felt really emotionally draining to me,it had so much drama in it and kim so hyun was rather cold and unfit for the role! Song kang had a lot of angst and i kept rooting for him because he is really a good kid. I was not upset that she ended with hye yeong because he liked her first but this is not a race nor should it be; she really broke Song kang&#39;s heart and it was very tasteless too! She couldn&#39;t give closure she was so self centered and manipulative. I can&#39;t believe i wasted my time watching this show. At first i hated Gul Mi but i saw how thoughtful and sincere she was towards the end they were just kids coming out of age and while i liked how the rest of the characters matured Kim So Hyun&#39;s character was still so ugly to me, a lot of emotional bagage. Unhealthy, toxic
