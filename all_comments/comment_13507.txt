I jst feel bad for sunho. He jst had to break up without even knowing the reason and now trailer is jst showing more about haeyeong only so I&#39;m jst so mad .haeyong didn&#39;t do anything wrong and always was with jojo bt the reason of him being with jojo all the time was there wasn&#39;t any thing that would make them uncomfortable but how could sunho would be with jojo when she heartlessy push him and even didn&#39;t give him any chance to know the reason so i dont think  haeyong is the only one who is loyal becz sunho even didn&#39;t get to see jojo bt love her after many years bt haeyong was always with her as afriend <br>So I jst hope there would be justice for sunho he deserves jojo and her love ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
