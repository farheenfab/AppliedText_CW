Even though the trailer sets it up like Jojo stays with Hye-Young....they almost seem better suited to be best friends. Hye-Young seems way more into Jojo than the other way around. I still think she gives Sun-oh another try. But the question remains, will Sun-oh want to? He has been wronged in all of this with no explanation from Jojo. I would like to see Sun-Oh turn off his Love Alarm off so he doesn’t ring Jojo’s alarm. He should move on initially and that would send a clear message to Jojo. <br><br>Having watched season 1 again, I am surprised that Hye-Young would attempt with Jojo considering how she wronged his best friend Sun-Oh.
