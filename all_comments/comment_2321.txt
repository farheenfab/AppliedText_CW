at first, i wanted jojo to end up with sun oh, but after seeing hye yeong&#39;s sacrifices even after getting hurt for so many times, he truly deserves Jojo, i am glad that they end up together. It would breally break my heart if they didn&#39;t!!! i mean sun oh is handsome, famous, rich and all, yeah he&#39;s all that,  it would be nice if he would end up with the other girl forgot her name.
