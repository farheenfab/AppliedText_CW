Everyones complaining about who JoJo ended up with but I just think the whole of season 2 was rushed af and was such a mess, there was no solid plot, seems like the directors cut off important scenes aswell. The story line in season 2 was confusing. Firstly they didn&#39;t even continue where we left off for season 1 which was a massive pivotal point, it was clear that there was a lot we &quot;missed out&quot;. We don&#39;t find out who was behind the &quot;anti love alarm protest (guy on the speaker&quot; and we also don&#39;t know the history between Brian Chon and Duk Gu, yeh they&#39;re brothers but where did he even come from LMAOOO. They made it so confusing. Duk Gu was in a coma? What??? We find out Hye yeongs dad is in jail and apparently Hye doesn&#39;t want to &quot;pretend to be the good guy anymore&quot;, then the rest of the episodes don&#39;t mention this part again as if there wasn&#39;t even a point to it. And the guy who was stalking JoJo, for the ringing world? Where did he even come from, and we find out he&#39;s a murder too. There&#39;s more but these are what I can think of at the top of my head. There&#39;s no answers to anything they threw into the whole of season 2, everything was as if writers didn&#39;t know what they were doing and had no structure to their ideas. This also caused  the series to be a bit boring and dull in my opinion.
