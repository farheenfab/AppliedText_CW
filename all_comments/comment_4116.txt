I loved this show dearly. I  watched season one back in February of last year, and I was SOOO excited to watch season 2 after waiting a full year for this new season. However, this one left me a bit empty. I really really wanted to see Sun-oh and Jojo end up together. Their chemistry is undeniable, and in season one, their storyline and love story brought me to tears. They&#39;re meant for each other, and it kind of broke my heart to see Jojo repeatedly reject him. I feel like they were endgame. And honestly, there was so much inner conflict and inner turmoil that Jojo was dealing with, that I truly believe she needed to work through first before ending up with anyone at all. I wish that this season explored that a bit more, as well as the many  other topics that were mentioned in season 1, but never brought up in season 2.  I think emotionally and mentally, season 1 truly impacted me more. It made me cry, and allowed me to truly feel the tangible depth of these characters&#39; emotions and love for each other. Season 2 was okay, but it didn&#39;t do any of that for me. I did enjoy being able to see the characters again though. Hopefully we get some more plot, storyline, and Sun-oh + Jojo in season 3
