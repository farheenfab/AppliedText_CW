I can appreciate both sides, but JoJo’s choice and the ending are very unsatisfying. I think S had a couple questionable tantrums/raised his voice a bit/was a tad overbearing and clingy, but I felt his love for her throughout every scene. As a matter of fact, the performance was very relatable when I think of my own first love (someone with unhealthy examples of love at home, shallow connections in past puppy love relationships, classic “you fell first, but they fell harder”). I don’t think H sold his feelings for her to the audience. He comes off resentful and we never see what tipped the scales of decisional balance to make him choose pursuing a relationship with JoJo over his best friend/brother - we’re left to assume it’s because of social class (I.e., working part-time, non-nuclear family) or increased vulnerability (I.e., screaming into the void). Personally, my dissatisfaction with the JoJo/H pairing is not due to the lack of physical touch, the anticlimactic slow burn or aesthetic preferences; they just aren’t as believable as JoJo and S. I, too, think her shitty communication regarding the real reason for the breakup is a tragic plot hole…but somewhat relatable in the modern online dating world. I just don’t care for the damaged friendship subplot between anyone other than H and S; her “best friend”, cousin, and all those mean girls are toxic AF and didn’t add much to the story given the ending. I thought the cousin would have a Romie &amp; Michelle type reunion with CDG, but nope! Given that the story glorifies ending lifelong friendships for potential love, I don’t see why her ex-bestie and ex-boyfriend didn’t get more character development. Lastly, Sun-oh should’ve stayed single, deleted that damn app, and been shown in therapy (individual and family) working through his shit…not promising to eventually ring Y-Jo’s alarm after a couple months of begging at her door. My guy literally told her she isn’t the main character in his story. Yikes.
