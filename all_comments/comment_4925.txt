Honestly all of those complaining for the ending I get it ...even I was team sun oh but this I am not at all disappointed by the ending they gave good ending for all..yes felt really bad for sun oh ..what was his fault ..but  hye young did deserved this ending ...he never even for a second had anyone except Kim jojo even though hevwas spectacle about whether she will ever love him or not ..still he kept going on ... either way she had to choose only one guy na...so everyone can&#39;t be happy at the same time but I liked the ending where second lead get the chance not like cliche&#39;s where even if it doesn&#39;t make sense the girl ends up with the first love because he is first ...that&#39;s not how it works
