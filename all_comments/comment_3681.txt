One of the best Kdrama I watched. Since s1 I rooted for Hye-young because he loved her and didn&#39;t rely on her loving him back or having his love alarm going off. He kept saying &quot;No&quot; to Su-ho about liking Jojo because of the promise he made to himself as a child to always protect su-ho and be there for him. Su-ho on the other hand knew Hye liked jojo yet he still pursued her. He should&#39;ve backed off if he really thought of Hye as a brother/friend and not pursued his bro/friends love interest even if hye was &quot;lying&quot; to him about liking jojo ... su-ho still knew and he was a dick for doing that to Hye. <br><br>In S2 ... even tho jo-jo never rang hye love alarm .. he didn&#39;t care. He still wanted to be by her side and show her that he loved her without wanting anything back except her sincerity and honesty. To be honest ... if Su-ho loved jo-jo that much ... he shouldn&#39;t have cared whether jo-jo couldn&#39;t ring his love alarm anymore. He should&#39;ve told jo-jo he didn&#39;t care about it and just wanted to support her and be there for her. But he relied too much on that love alarm and never thought with his own heart. Him not ending up with jo-jo is better for him because now he has to work hard to show someone he loves them and EARN their love too and not just rely on the love alarm.<br><br>P.S. Suho was a shit friend to Hye. Hye was always there for Su-ho but it was never the other way around. When in S2 Hye wanted to move out and live his life ... Suho only thought about himself &quot;who will I depend on now? Who will solve MY problems now? blah blah blah&quot; like get the f over it dude. Hye has his own life and his own goals and ambitions and not be your servant. Hye didn&#39;t even feel the need to tell Su-ho about his father&#39;s situation. If su-ho was really a true friend.... Hye would&#39;ve felt comfortable relying on him instead of dealing with it all by himself. While Hye always had su-hos back when it came to his family problems. Rant over<br><br>Loved the ending!
