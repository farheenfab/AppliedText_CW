Difference between Sunjo and Hyejo love stories.<br><br>Sunjo: Started with a physical attraction and obsession before love, Jojo said when they kissed, if they had love alarm on at the moment, their love alarms wouldn&#39;t have rang cause the urge to kiss came before love for both of them. Their love wasn&#39;t built on a solid foundation cause they barely knew eachother except they knew they had scars from their parents. Why did they break up? <br> There was a break in communication. The shield was a block. One person felt insecure and small and couldn&#39;t hold on. If they really knew and loved eachother so much why did they break up and why couldn&#39;t they wait for one another? Have you asked yourself this?. I guess not cause you haven&#39;t seen this. Also, if Jojo loved Sun Oh so much like most of you made it seem like, why didn&#39;t she use the spear on him and decided to use it on Hye Yeong, cause she had moved on and fallen in love with another person, it&#39;s as simple as that.<br>During Sun Oh and Jojo&#39;s high school days, they were very immature and never really understood what love really is. Of course they had this picture of love being all sparkles and roses and not the difficult part of it. It was the flash of lightning before thunder and when they got to thunder, everything came crashing down.<br><br>Hyejo: Started off as genuinely getting to know eachother and being there for one another, they went on dates talking about their likes and dislikes. They saw the broken parts of eachother and didn&#39;t try to magically fix it, what they needed was eachother, being a companion and not a lover cause that&#39;s what they needed. They went on a journey of healing, If Jojo never loved Hye Yeong like most of you people make it seem like, why would she give him hope by saying, &quot;I can&#39;t ring your alarm but I&#39;m trying to find happiness, are you okay with that?. She said that cause she saw something special in Hye Yeong and had the courage to pursue love.<br><br>Duk Gu said everything happened as a result of timing and volition. Jojo&#39;s alarm was a bug cause she didn&#39;t clearly understand and trust her feelings and relied on the app to protect herself cause she was scared, the moment she felt sure of her feelings, she felt the only was to tell the other person was to ring his alarm cause in their world, if you love someone, it had to ring, that shows how scared she was confessing with words. That was the point of the drama.
