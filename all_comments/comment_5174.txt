I wasted 2 years waiting for this <a href="http://drama.it/">drama.It</a> would have been better if they wouldn’t have released the second season at all. I will never watch another drama of this director Kim Jin Woo. I still had expectations despite all these trailer and hints. What a content guess they don’t excel at their work. Business these days satisfy customers wants and over here if they would have brought a slight change in the ending I swear this would have been my best K-drama. Thanks for disappointing me and wasting my time and net as well. I didn’t think that a drama that I have been eagerly waiting for would have been the worst drama that I have watched it’s all because of my high expectations and thanks for letting me know that a Kdrama can be this bad.
