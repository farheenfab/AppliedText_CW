I can&#39;t understand why everybody seems to ship Jojo and Sun Ho <br>Well i can, people love the actor, he seems to be the main character in season one and Hye young is the second lead, that alone makes people think they are watching&quot;Jojo and Sun ho&#39;s love story&quot; BUT that just  would make this drama like any other. I know that even tho Hye young loved Jojo first (and Sun ho was only interested in Jojo after he knew that, some jealousy or envy no his part) Jojo liked Sun ho best, BUT that doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s love, what they have is in high school when they are both young. I just want to see some reality and common sense in this drama, Hye young can be the love of his adult life (think of how many high school couples end up together AND happy in the future) i know this is just a show but i&#39;ve been following the story paying attention to ALL characters and Hye young was ALWAYS there for a reason
