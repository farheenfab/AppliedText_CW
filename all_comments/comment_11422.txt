I&#39;m among the minority who wants her to end up with Hyeyoung.. it&#39;s been like that since S1 but they took so long for S2 that it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. &amp; it&#39;s just a drama anyways so idc. but all the teaser &amp; now the trailer for S2 seems like it&#39;s gonna be Hyeyoung afterall
