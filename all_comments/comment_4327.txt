All u guys care about is the ships. Not what the message love alarm 2 is trying to portray us. Alot of u aren&#39;t even gonna watch season 2 bcs yr fav ain&#39;t getting the lead girl but not caring about the fact why he wasn&#39;t the chose one. Trust me I was team sun oh in 1st season but season 2 literally changed my mind and made me team hye yeong. Hye yeong deserved the girl much more than sun oh did coz he was willing to wait for her, give her time and most importantly healing her pain she&#39;s been through all these years. Hye yeong was the comfort she needed in her life and all the time they spent together she developed feelings for him. Coz why not? Feelings do change! We meet a person in our life who comes and heals our pain who wouldn&#39;t fell for that? As said by director we waited 2 years to make 2nd season so even the actors would grow and potray their characters well and so it was done in season 2. It&#39;s your choice if u don&#39;t wanna watch it but trust me it&#39;s a realistic ending and beautifully potrayed. I just wish some things could&#39;ve been better here and there. But it was perfect story.
