I think... Sun Oh needs at least one person he loves and loves him back, and I think Jojo is his destiny. They both went through the same trauma as their parents. Their parents tried to kill them and they were able to survived from it, then why can&#39;t Jojo and Sun Ohâ€™s love last? Jojo and Sun Oh have the same destiny, I hope they end up together and have a happy ending :)
