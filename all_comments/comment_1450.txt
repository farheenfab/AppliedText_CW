I love them!!! 😭❤️ to be honest, the feels that I&#39;m feeling right now in Love alarm is same with Scarlet Heart. Because at first, Hae soo and Wang wook are inlove with each other but she ended up having feelings with Wang So. Here in Love alarm, I&#39;m getting the same feeling 😭 I really want Jojo to end up with Sun Oh because I can&#39;t move on with their chemistry and I want to see more of their love story. Although I like Hye Yeong also but as her friend only. I hope they will change the ending in season 2 😭 I&#39;m really hoping for Jojo and Sun Oh to have their second chance because I know they still love each other :(((
