Now I didn’t care who she ended up with. However, they just skipped what happened at the end of season 1 and made it like it didn’t exist. Also, I don’t remember the main couple here as a couple in season 1. I felt like it was rushed. Jojo never really clarified on why she installed the shield. It’s like they just switch the whole storyline and just included the love alarm app!
