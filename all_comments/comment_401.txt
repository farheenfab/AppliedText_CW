I regret watching this.<br> I mean it hurts seeing people change in front of your eyes, losing the person you love without any proper reason.<br> Though I felt happy for Yeong(cause he was always worth of loving) but sad for Sun-oh at the same time(cause he did nothing wrong, he didn&#39;t deserve heartbreak). <br>Perfect example of &quot;People change,their love change too&quot; ðŸ˜„
