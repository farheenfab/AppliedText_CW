I simply don&#39;t understand why people aren&#39;t happy with jojo and hye yeong, they show us the love in it&#39;s true form,when sun ho was busy kissing jojo ,hye yeong cared about how she feel and understanding what was she going through,for him it doesn&#39;t matter if she makes him happy or ring his alarm,he just wanted to make her happy and be there for her no matter what the situation is,while sun oh always keep fighting for why can&#39;t she ring her alram,so that&#39;s why she chooses hye yeong over sun oh,that doesn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t love sun ho or hated him ,it just as she said it was heavy.❤️
