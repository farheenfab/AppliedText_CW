A big spoiler <br><br>When I started watching episode 1 of season 2 <br>I didn&#39;t care at all about who jojo is going to pick (before I was on sun-oh side) <br><br>After I got bored I watched the last episode&#39;s end and guess what...<br><br>Jojo picked Hyojeong idk what happened to sun-oh... That&#39;s when it hit me that I wanted sun-oh and jojo to end up together it really hurtsðŸ˜¥<br>I don&#39;t want to watch any kdrama&#39;s anymore
