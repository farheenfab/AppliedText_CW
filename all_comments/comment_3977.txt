All of Sun Oh haters didnt even realized that he got dump without even knowing the reason, then got replaced with his BESTFRIEND since his childhood. Sun Oh got fked up, glad that he didnt end up with Jojo coz she doesnt deserve him. Kinda wish Jojo didnt ended with anyone coz she&#39;s just confused of every feeling she gets.
