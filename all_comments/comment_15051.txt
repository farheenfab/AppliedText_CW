They deserve happy ending... why Netflix  apart them away in both season 1 and 2 . I can&#39;t handle this . Recently my boyfriend broken up with me while I&#39;m loving him more than I imagine after watching this drama I felt how much pain really inside in my heart. It&#39;s really difficult to handle such type of feeling as long as it is our first love. We can&#39;t erase the memories of our first love and all sweet past memories became pain after that . Any way all those things remind me my past love life , So if you are going to make another season plz give happy ending for this couple .
