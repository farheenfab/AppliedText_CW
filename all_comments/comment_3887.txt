I just finished both seasons and soooo disappointed with the ending. The chemistry that&#39;s built in season 1 was so strong just to be messed up like that. It&#39;s actually so strong that despite the efforts to make jojo and  hye young to have their own chemistry in season 2, you would still be waiting for jojo and sun-oh to be together. The characters appear to have a happy ending all in good terms but it&#39;s tragic for many viewers. For those who enjoyed the ending, good for them. For those who watched the series because of song kang, I feel you.
