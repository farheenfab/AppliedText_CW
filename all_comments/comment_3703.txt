Season 1 was def better than s2. S2 was just so boring. I didn&#39;t care with whom jojo was gonna end up, I just wanted to end this drama. Like girl pick a side quickly. This drama lacked so much communication. My girl jojo was crying most of the times 🤦‍♀️ I still don&#39;t understand why jojo has to leave sun oh like why?? Like he deserved better... this series is just so complicated that I don&#39;t want to watch something like this again
