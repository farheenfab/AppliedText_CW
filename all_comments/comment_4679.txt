They really hurt Sunoh for no reason.... He didn&#39;t smile at all the entire season except for at the end which still felt superficial ngl. He spent 4 years suffering and in pain, not having answers as to what went wrong. Even when he found out, it still didn&#39;t make sense which hurt him even more. Okay, she installed the shield and broke up with him because she was scared of hurting anyone or being hurt. So why did she start dating Hyeyong if that was her reason??
