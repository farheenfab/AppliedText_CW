All I want one decent drama where song kang doesn’t cry. I want sun-ho to end up with that blonde girl and the other guy to end up with some girl, and for jojo she should stay single so, she could figure out what she wants actually. Homie being confused and hurting all the characters of this drama, she’ll suffer, let the other characters suffer and us too.
