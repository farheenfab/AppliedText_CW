I swear..Jojo still likes Sunoh hands down. That’s why she tries to avoid him and be with Hye yeong. But she honestly can’t escape it. I love Hye yeong but imma have to be team Sunoh 🤚🏽<br><br><br>Omg over 1k people agree...that just shows that Team Sunoh is unstoppable 😌 but i also do believe that Hye yeong should find someone that will treat him the way he treats Jojo because I think he deserves better.
