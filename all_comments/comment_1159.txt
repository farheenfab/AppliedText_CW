i&#39;d read some statement about lovealarm season 2 but jojo prefer hyeyeong after all in that webtoon but wth if she&#39;s prefer hyeyeong then why bother to have 8 ep with full of sun oh-jojo sweetness scene ,  for real i just want sun oh to be happy after all he got bad memories back then when he was a kid like wth okey both of them let jojo choose who jojo likes and jojo choose sun oh instead hyeyeong why hyeyeong must confess his feeling towards jojo after 4years? i really need sun oh to be happy with jojo and jojo must be honest to sun oh. i wonder why jojo must do  that but she has her own reason but after 4years? its a long time tho why she cant be honest when sun oh ask her grr
