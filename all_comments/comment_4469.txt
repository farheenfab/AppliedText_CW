I just read a Korean article saying one of the main character is now serving the military (drafted) and I&#39;m wondering that&#39;s why they rushed with this ending to end the show at season 2? I think it was supposed to go up to season 3. The original webtoon is still going if you guys want a different ending. The cartoonist is battling a hand disease so she draws with her voice using cinema 3d. The process is pretty cool and she shares her process to encourage people with disabilities and taking people on her journey. She is a true legend who have published many iconic cartoons when I was a teenager so I would love for everyone to support her webtoon as well &lt;3 Didn&#39;t expect this ending either but I think the message was well-recieved since I&#39;ve also been feeling like romance is dead with all these apps and now we don&#39;t talk to strangers anymore (now even more thanks to rona) and are less committal.
