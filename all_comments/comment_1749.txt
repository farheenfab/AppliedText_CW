Get this shit kdrama out of my eyes...i was so lucky that i haven’t watch this drama or i would have been depressed for years. I hate this drama&#39;s storyline! This drama was made to depress/ suffer for the one who shipped jojo and sunho. Well there are so many dramas where the 2nd lead gets so much suffer bt still i have never got depressed bt after i watched the last ep of &quot;love alarm&quot; s1 my mind was clearly blank out and depressed, just thinking Why did jojo did this to sunho, she literally ended sunho&#39;s smile from his face..i can&#39;t even imagine the moment when i heard he didn’t got the girl.<br>i just cried,cried,cried, i was awake for 3 night and couldn’t sleep. This drama made me trapped. it was my fav drama and now this drama has been removed from my kdrama list + my mind. <br><br><br>I hate the Writer ! <br>I hate the Writer!<br>I hate the writer !<br>I hate the drama!<br>I hate the drama!<br>I hate the drama!<br>Worst kdrama ever in history!<br>I Curse the writer!
