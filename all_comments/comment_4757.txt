So, to be honest, I used to have high expectations for the second season, since the first was really promising. However, I was very deluded and I am going to say why.<br>First of all, it&#39;s too slow. I usually really really enjoy a slow time in movies or TV series, but, considering it is just about 6 episodes, it was too much. By the way, main reasons are the next. There are too many things which are completely not explained. The reason why Jojo broke up with Sun is not clear even once, it feels just like an excuse to make some random drama. Even if he asks for the answer multiple times, of course, he never receives a satisfactory response, because basically there is none. Also, I think it was not given enough space to Duk Goo and his relation with his brother stays a mystery.  But let&#39;s go with the main characters. After four years of relationship, Jojo doesn&#39;t menage to receive a kiss from Hee-young, but, after all, when Sun comes to her university out of the blue (they didn&#39;t see each other in a long time) she immediately let him kiss her. <br>The second season always keeps the hope of them turning back together extremely on , until the very end, but, eventually, it ends with the big delusional choice by everyone to not be happy. Jojo and Hee-young keep having troubles in their relationship and it&#39;s the same for Sun and Yook Jo, in fact they smartly decided to take their distance in a first moment. Yook Jo clearly says Sun will never forget Jojo and it&#39;s the point, it&#39;s completely true. Sun can&#39;t show emotions for Yook Jo and it doesn&#39;t matter how much he wait. We all know he will never be able to make her alarm sound. Love is not a compromise, it is not a substitute, it is not a &quot;knowing how to settle&quot;. Similarly, Hee-young is egoistic while knowing the relationship with Jojo is only based on his own feelings, he doesn&#39;t take care of the real feelings of Jojo, even she is obviously not in love. It doesn&#39;t make sense that eventually we discover her alarm made the sounds during the time she spent with him. Again, it&#39;s just a try to justifie the fact she remains with him. Jojo, equally, is not able to say the true to him or to speak sincerely, but she takes her time taking advantage of Hee-young&#39;s weakness. I bet her alarm would sound during the scenes when she meets Sun again. She told him that she made a &quot;choice&quot;. She made the choice to love Hee-young and that&#39;s all about her will. But here it is where everything is wrong. Love IS NOT a choice. We can&#39;t choose who we are going to love, no matter what. She forces herself from the first moment to fall in love with Hee-young just to have company. When Sun asks for the reason of their breakup, she says she thought that, if she had left, he would have smiled more. But...come on... he was became a dead body for four years because of you, he didn&#39;t smile ONCE so why would you ever think that. Basically, we have four characters who eventually are not satisfied at all: Jojo will never be sure of her feelings, in her heart there is always a part of her divided between the two. She regrets, in the deep. Hee-young is completely blind for the love he feels for Jojo, so she basically could hurt him forever, but he would keep accepting everything from her. That&#39;s not positive, just unhealthy. He never really respects himself. Sun feels the pressure of knowing that he has to surrender to the fact he loves someone who he could not have and also he is afraid of make suffer someone who has pure feelings for him. He is deeply ashamed and depressed. Yook Jo will live a relationship alone, destinate to finish, extremely unhappy, because she is aware of the essential deficit of love she is going to accept.<br>I found the explanation which gave Duk Goo not enough satisfying. He said Jojo was insicure just because Hee-young&#39;s alarm didn&#39;t sound. But, the true is that she still reacts to Sun precence. It is not easy at all understanding the point where her alarm stops to sound for Sun and starts to sound for Hee-young. Why should it stop? She was spending her time hoping to get used to Hee-young&#39;s love. And it&#39;s the same for Sun, since he try to get used to Yook Jo (he literally says this to her in the last episode: &quot;I may not make your alarm sound now, but I&#39;ll come today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and MAYBE someday, it will sound&quot;. That&#39;s not nice. It&#39;s just rude and disrespectful). It&#39;s all an acting, like Sun&#39;s mom does. Acting and pretending something will give eventually nothing genuinely true. I would prefer the series would be more educative and would show more how the most beautiful part of emotions is the hidden one. All the characters suffer so bad for this app and it takes nothing good to anyone. The series doesn&#39;t really want to show how terrible would be a planet with something like Love alarm in our daily life, but somehow it kind of accept it. The world is modern, people are happy in the background and everyone wants to hear the sound. There are haters yes, but the society generally accepts Love alarm. No one never talks about uninstall it. It is shown as positive and cool in the deep. Maybe, I would prefer seeing the Love alarm app eliminated and erased from the world, but we just have a world which keeps basing the relationships on a sound. <br>That&#39;s sad.<br>I have to mention that all the actors, the recording, songs and everything were really good and with this words I just want to give my opinion exclusively about the plot and the moral. It was made a big job with excellent quality and I&#39;ve really appreciated that ‚ù§Ô∏èüëè
