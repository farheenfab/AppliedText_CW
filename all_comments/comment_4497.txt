Really happy with the ending.<br>Team Hye Yeong always. I get tht Sun oh was really nice and was Jojo first love. But we cant ignore the fact tht Hye yeong was a keeper. As a frnd he was honest and sacrificed his love for Jojo in starting. If I would have been in Jojo&#39;s place I would have chose Hye Yeong over and over again no matter wht. I just love him, a guy so selfless without being desperate to win the love is an idle person.
