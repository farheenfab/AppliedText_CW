I’m sooo disappointed!! Hate hate hate season 2... literally waited too long for this and it ended up a disappointment! To you writers, we know you worked hard on this but you made a dumb, confusing season 2.. the ending of season 1, where was it? Or where is it? Why didn’t you guys just continue where you left off instead of writing a whole one.. Wasted my time watching. If there is a season 3, don’t think I’ll watch. We have to wait couple months or another year... love Sun Oh! ♥️♥️
