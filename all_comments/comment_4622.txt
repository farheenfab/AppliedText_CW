And she ends up with hye yeong...I wished that she would end up with Sun ho.. My heart is broken into million pieces...<br><br>Edit: Though I am happy for Hye yeong, But My Sunjo heart still hurts. He loved Jojo so much. Yukjo should have broken up with Sun-ho because there is no relationship without love from both sides. But her love is one sided. They could have still be friends after break up. Because it&#39;s not Sun-ho fault that he doesn&#39;t like Yukjo. This is for Hye yeong too. I don&#39;t hate Hye yeong tho, they were a cute couple. So this season gets only 2 stars from me.
