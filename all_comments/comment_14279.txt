Personally, I always want hye yeong to win and get Jojo&#39;s heart at the end, sun oh is good but being with him will cause a lot of problems to Jojo at the end and I have a sense that Sun oh mom not gonna like Jojo. Like True beauty, I always wanna Suho win jugyeong because he&#39;s the 1st person who accepted jugyeong at her worst and he deserved her at her best, break up with seo jun is probably the worst for jugyeong but she should notice how much Suho loved Herr. ðŸ’—
