Damn that was intense, so JJ and HY low-key date, but she rings SO love Alarm, so they have a small fling, and you can see that she disappears on HY phone from being able to like him, but then she runs away from SO whilst still ringing his alarm and what I assume is JJ talks to Duk Goo about who does she really like. Which in the end I think will boil down to HY based on this trailer as reality trumps an app and the company/app fails in the end since they turned bad when they kicked DG out.<br><br>That would make the most since they wouldn&#39;t want to end it by romanticizing finding love through an app all the way through I think.<br><br>The only other option is they don&#39;t thrash the app, and she somehow just finds love for HY without the app.<br><br>I was team SO for the longest time (and I still sort of am) but I think that&#39;s just due to how they portray S1. But I still think it ends with HY in S2 and there is adequate reason for it too.<br><br>Edit: in the scene where she asks &quot;tell me who do I like&quot; (which I speculate to be DG) right after she steps into someone else&#39;s radius which trailer wise feels like HY (the unexpected happens) why would they show her walking into SO again you know. As they look to end up on bad terms in the trailer<br><br>Edit2: The only case I can make for her ending up with SO based on this trailer would be them kissing again as the only other drama I&#39;ve seen where the FL kisses the 2nd ML is Wok of Love out of the 130 dramas I&#39;ve watched.
