I liked the end very much, a serie where they gave the opportunity to the second role, and they did not deal with him as a source of excitement for events only, he gave her all his attention and love, and she was looking for that, so this is the right person for her, she loved him also because she felt that he was like her and  He will understand her more than the first hero , for me this is the most beautiful ending
