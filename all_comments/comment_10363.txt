I am literally crying because people in the comment section keep on saying things like &quot; If jojo doesn&#39;t end up with sun-ho then I will kill the director.&quot; like I thought of it as a joke until people started saying things about killing people and that they will stop watching kdramas. Then other people are saying like &quot; I understood the whole drama and I am still mad that she left sun-ho.&quot; Like, If you really paid attention to the drama, then you would know why she left him and it was for a good cause. Then other people are saying &quot; I don&#39;t want this to be another True Beauty.&quot; I was team Sejoun as well (don&#39;t get me wrong I was sad too), but if people can&#39;t move on from that drama and how it ended, then how will they move on from this one.  You can&#39;t hold on to something forever. I wish I could say why it would be good if she ended up with Hye yeong, but I know I would just recieve so much hate by people. I just want this drama to end so that people would stop with threats and why sun-ho or hye yeong are better. please just accept with who she is going to end up with. Imagine yourself in Jojo&#39;s shoes. You like two guys because they are both kind to you, but people keep on threatening you to end up with one of them. of course that would just make you confused, and sad that people think that controlling your own feelings is easy. no one can control their own feelings. If you like two guys, then you like them. There is no way you can pursue yourself to like one person or stop liking another.
