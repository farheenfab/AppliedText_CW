Honestly I am pretty biased for Hyeyeong because why not but at this point specially after watching this trailer I feel she is hurting both of their feelings<br>She needs to come clean and give both of them an explanation and If its not Hyeyeong at the end the writers better give him the best ending because my boy deserves the world
