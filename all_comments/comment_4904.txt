SPOILER ALLERT!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Sry but the second season was so disappointing i already thougt that she would not choose sun-oh but the mood in the whole season was just so depressing and it looked like everyone of them just hated their lifes and constantly someone was crying. It was just not enjoyable at all. I mean jojo just literally ripped sun-ohs heart apart and she also hurt his friend. Just everything was so down the whole time... at least the ending wasnâ€™t that bad ( last 20 minutes)
