I really struggle to understand why so many in the comments section support Sun-oh. He stepped on his best friend&#39;s feelings, stalked a girl whilst she was walking home who was already in a relationship, caused her to lose her social circle at school and then after the time skip dated a girl who he had no feelings for, leading her on when he loved someone else (he never told her this by the way) and the things he said to Hye-young when he was moving out were horrible. Hye-young never lashed out despite his feelings being hurt, he was there for Sun-oh and his romance with Jojo feels more authentic and less toxic to me. The Sun-oh relationship reminds me more of your first love in high school where it&#39;s just a whirlwind of emotions, but it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re a good fit. Then again people could just be supporting Sun-oh because the actor is hot ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
