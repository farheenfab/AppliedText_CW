<b>Spoiler alert</b> Does everyone forget that HY loved her first? He stood aside while she dated SO in high school and let them be, but always took care of them both. The writers didn&#39;t make a mistake on this. He loved her regardless and wanted her happiness over his. Folks wanting her to end up with SO missed the entire first season of how the longer she stayed with him the more she felt miserable about herself, her dark past and when his parents kept him away from her after Jeju accident (and SO even explained that he cld have gone to her then but chose to wait a few days) it became even more clear to her that she cld never level up to SO. Which is why she got that shield. Yes SO had an unhappy family and its tragic but he is a spoiled rich kid who still grew up with two (horrible, negligent, self absorbed) parents. He doesn&#39;t understand the other two&#39;s deeper struggle. So S2 explained it and allowed HY to express his original feelings fully. I say good job writers!
