SPOILERS<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>They should make a season 3 with an alternate ending where she ultimately ends up with Sunoh.Throughout s2 they portrayed it in a way that kinda made it seem like Jojo was still in love with Sunoh but she was using the shield as an excuse to not give him any closure or confess that she had lingering feelings for him; All while she was with Hyeyoung. Idk, ig if the writers were a little more clear with their intentions from the beginning, the ending wouldn’t have disappointed so many fans. In s1 she installed the shield so she wouldn’t end up hurting anyone/end up getting hurt herself but she literally ended up hurting everyone including herself. Jojo did it to “protect” Sunoh but she just ruined him &amp; then went to his bff. Also, she was willing to remove the shield for Hyeyoung but not Sunoh? She even said that if she had to go back in time, she would choose to install the shield again🙄 Then in s2, Deokgu said Jojo’s liked Hyeyoung from the beginning, like bro don’t lie, her entire world revolved around Sunoh in s1. No one can deny the chemistry they had back then. Honestly, I’m gunna need to read the webtoon since the drama is all over the place.
