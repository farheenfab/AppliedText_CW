Was I the only one who felt Sun-Ohs pain? Her logic and trauma did not correlate because she was scared of hurting him so she did it herself. Instead of talking to him she was selfish and hurt him. Hye-yong is a great person but he never acted out on his feelings until AFTER SUN-OH DID. And he was upfront about how he felt and pursued his feelings. He even got his a** kicked for her. He always opened up and went out of his way for her. Dude this is the first time I connect to a male lead and itâ€™s was so heartbreaking. Instead of talking to him she went and opened up to someone else? Tf is that?! <b>sobs</b> lol I love both male leads but Sun-Oh better not get played like that cause I will lose it.
