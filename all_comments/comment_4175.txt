I LOVED SEASON 2! ❤️ <br>Very realistic and I personally thought the scriptwriter did an amazing job in connecting seasons 1 and 2. This is the female protagonist&#39;s journey from childhood to adulthood trying to understand her feelings and cope with pain. In season 2 we got more depth into the characters and how their personalities affect them as adults and why things unfolded the way they did. Anyways, a handful of people are complaining about the ending and all I have to say is that it made perfect sense and I loved that it was her volition-conscious choice, not the Love Alarm. Love is complex and not everything stays the same. So I hope they leave it like that because honestly, it wouldn&#39;t make sense to have a Season 3 since everything wrapped up nicely other than the minor details here and there. But if you are thinking about watching this series then I think you should definitely watch with an open mind and not concentrate on the romance, but how the female is able to deal with survivors guilt and make peace with herself.
