Thr s always that person who r we fated to love and someone who will be our love, some says it&#39;s about faith, somes says it&#39;s about timing, eitht way it&#39;s not about who come first.. it&#39;s by our choice, although I wish it was the male lead, we are all bound to choose the most comfortable and easy way to love..
