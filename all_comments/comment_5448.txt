People been ranting about JoJo&#39;s decision lol where in a matter of fact Hyeyeong deserved to be the endgame. If y&#39;all don&#39;t watch carefully the s1 then you&#39;re missing the part where Hyeyeong was the one who deserves Jojo. If I could I will make power point presentation or essay consisting of 5000 words why Hyeyeong deserved Jojo.
