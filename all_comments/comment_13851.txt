It&#39;s kinda dissapointed if Jojo end up with Hyeyoung. I knew this guy love her for a long time and still to be patient. But, Sun-Oh broke up with Jojo in season 1 was not fair. Sun Oh never know why was Jojo ending up their relationship. I mean, they have to be open minded to each other and solve the problems together. Jojo, why are you shut up? You choose the wrong way. The goal is good, but it finally hurting Sun OhðŸ˜­
