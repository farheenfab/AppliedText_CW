To me Sun oh was only wrong when he approached Jojo knowing his best friend Hye Young likes her other than that he was never wrong please don&#39;t blame him for being toxic and immature when Jojo literally made a fool out of him and ruined four years of his life she left him without giving any reasonable explaination you clearly see sun oh was toxic but you people close your eyes when the toxic and immature behavior of Jojo is shown wow fantastic
