I just came from watching season two and wtfðŸ¤§<br>SPOLIER ALERT: ðŸš¨ <br>She chooses hye yeong<br><br>I just donâ€™t think it doesnâ€™t make sense. Yes, he waited for her, but I feel like her feelings for hye yeong were forced somehow. Like she felt bad for being mean to him when he was so nice to her idk my heartâ€™s just so broken. Like maybe if she met and talked it out with sun-oh, they could have been the endgame. I know itâ€™s a kdrama and itâ€™s more realistic for it to be that way but i just donâ€™t think Kim jojo had more reasons to choose hye-yeong over sun-oh
