I stopped watching when I saw the writing of the last season&#39;s last episode written:- <b>&quot;Jo-Jo ended up with Hye-young&quot;..</b><br><br>If u are in the team of Song kang, don&#39;t watch after episode 5 of first season..<br><br>Like why tf she ended up with Sun-oh even he was requesting her.. If I was there, I would have kissed him when he came to me.. Too bad for u girl..😒<br><br>Btw, I love Song Kang❤saranghae❤
