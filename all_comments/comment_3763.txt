Such a stupid drama…..like i know hye young was a good guy…but did jojo even liked him…in s1 whenever she saw him she was like he is sun oh best friend but suddenly he confessed and they started dating…also there was not a single reason why she break up with sun oh…..first she said she doesn’t want to date someone after breaking with sun oh (the park scene) and then suddenly spending time with hye yeong….like girl if she wanted to date someone she could date anyone but why with hye yeong knowing he and sun oh like were brothers…just wasted my time watching this drama…also there was no character development of her…she was exactly the same  from the start….i have never be so disappointed after watching a kdrama…..it is literally trash
