I feel like Sun-oh was her first love, her teenage love, but her real love from the beginning and the one she&#39;s destined to have now as an adult is Hye-yeong. Like c&#39;mon guys, why would they show in the very first episode Hye-yeong&#39;s crush on her and keep milking it throughout the show if it wasn&#39;t gonna happen. Sun-oh is just freakin creepy at this point shouting out &quot;YOU STILL LIKE ME&quot; like bitch move on..
