I love Sun oh. But getting back at Jojo is toxic already. Look how Sun oh begged for love!!!! They&#39;ve already hurt each other so bad that returning to him will not repair the damage at all. <br><br>As for Hye yong, she respects her to the point that he always choose to understand and prove his love even without the alarm. He knows he loved her from a distance and he waited for her.
