Both Jojo and Sun oh grew up with little or no love at all. Maybe that&#39;s why it didn&#39;t work out with them. They don&#39;t know that communication is the key to a healthy relationship. Unlike Hye young, who had so much love from his mom, he was taught what love really is. Patience, kindness, understanding, and humility. Hye young had experienced those all of his life that&#39;s why he was able to love Jojo unconditionally and spent time getting to know more of her. Jojo and Sun-oh were never able to understand their true feelings because they never tried to talk it out.
