I hope that Netflix delayed the season 2 to change the whole script and make Sunoh a Jojo stay together after all... if they even DARE to make Jojo chose Hye Yong over Sun Oh, I swear I will cancel my Netflix subscription and never watch content in there. I CANNOT TAKE MORE OF THIS! MY HEART JUST CAN&#39;T!!! T___T
