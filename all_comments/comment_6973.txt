Omg all I’m seeing is “Sunho” comments. Am I the only one who is rooting for Hyeyeong? Yes, Sunho and her were great in the beginning but Hyeyeong was patient and even deleted the app to not bother her. Sunho not only went after her when his friend liked her (although we eventually forgive because they were cute and Hyeyeong stayed in the background) but now is using the cute blonde too. They were a cute couple in high school but I feel like Hyeyeong is her adulthood love. He’s filling that gap. I do feel bad for Sunho but he’s not handling things too well.... 🤷🏻‍♀️. Don’t hate on me, it is just a show and this is just my opinion but I’m open for discussion!
