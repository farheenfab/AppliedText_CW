One of the first Kdrama that have a great ending. I’m tired of seeing ending of an ordinary girl and popular/perfect guy. Overall, Hye Yeong deserves her, he looks after her since season 1. Not only that, he was protecting Sun-Oh even though he hurts like hell when he found out about Sun-Oh and Jojo. He was so mature and respectful when it comes to one-side love in season 1. Praise to the writer of this drama!!👏🏼👏🏼
