Lesson Iâ€™ve learned in season 2 is that we dont need app/ internet to find true love and happines . Jojo end up to hye yeong because hye yeong work hard to make her fall in love . He never left her alone in her side and he really waited for so long for her . Unlike suh- oh , she used to liked her because of the love alarm . Whatâ€™s important here  is the lessons we learned from this drama , not who she end up with . ðŸŒ¸
