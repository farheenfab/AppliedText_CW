Im getting the im the end game vibe from hye yong. And i dont like it.. please o please eveb though hye young obviously didnt do anything bad.. i just live for sun oh and jojo.. like please they&#39;ve suffered enough.. hye young didnt get jojo&#39;s love at all.. so it be easier to move on.. but sun oh and jojo&#39;s love got taken when it was still new so the feelings should get stronger base on the fact that their feelings goes through difficult time.. doesnt it.. isnt that always the case with feelings??
