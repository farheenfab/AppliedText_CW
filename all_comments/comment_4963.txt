It&#39;s a wholesome journey - Jojo admitted she was burdened by her past and she became scared therefore she ends her relationship with Sun Oh abruptly. But like she said, she would put up the shield again because she does not have the courage to take Sun Oh on the same ride because she&#39;s not strong to support him. Instead, Hyeyoung uplifts her spirit, in a way she had hoped she would uplift someone like that, which Jojo returned the favor when Hye Young facing the dread parole request from his father whos serving murder&#39;s life sentence.¬†And we cannot say Sun oh was left behind by the drama because he also grows as a person by being there for Jojo, Hye young, and especially Yuk Jo.<br><br>I had to say, I&#39;m so glad the director sticks to the writing although much was left from the live-action. Just like I enjoy the first season, I also enjoyed the second one. The vulnerable Jojo, the matured and yet sensitive Hye Yeong, and the emotional but honest Sun Oh.¬† üíñ¬†<br><br>Sometimes, we coincide with other people to learn how to grow as a person. So I believe, such thing as team Hye young or team Sun oh should not be in the way of a beautiful story to be told. Because they both end up with good people in the story. A good story. ‚ù£Ô∏è
