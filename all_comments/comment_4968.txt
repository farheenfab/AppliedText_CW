Honestly super disappointed, the acting was so amazing but they did not do justice for the plot, the script, the character development, and sun oh’s ending especially. Jojo’s character in season 2 rlly irked me because she was so submissive and all she rlly had were crying scenes, and tbh that’s all season 2 rlly was, just crying scenes. They didn’t do sun oh justice especially the fact that he never got a reason as to why jojo broke up with him. The story is all over the place, it was bad writing and extremely rushed for no reason. The webtoon isn’t even finished yet, there could still clearly be a chance for sun oh and jojo but tbh I already lost interest in jojo because her character was just so horribly written. Hye yeoung is amazing dont get me wrong, but where’s the love and passion? I felt so much joy for season 1 bc I could honestly feel the love through sun oh and jojo, they truly had no reason to break up, there is no good storyline as to why jojo and sun oh didn’t end up together and why she even started dating Hye yeoung, the kdrama is an absolute mess, I’d personally forget it and and just pretend season 1 was the finale 🤷🏻‍♀️
