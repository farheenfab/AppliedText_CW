if it&#39;s all about reality then better choose hye young. he is the best of all the best choice jojo need. sunoh is just a fantasy. boys like him exist just to continue hurting other people. when talking about love it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you will choose him because you like him. there&#39;s more to it. there are some people who ended up with someone they just met recently than the one they&#39;ve loved for a very long time. why? because they are not good for them even though they love them. they simply choose them because that&#39;s what is good for them and not for the other people. not because a majority said to choose the other guy then it&#39;s always right.
