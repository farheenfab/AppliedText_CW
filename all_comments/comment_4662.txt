Am I the only one who is really satisfied with the plot of Love Alarm SS2 :)<br>With me, it is not about who she gonna end up with but how she becomes more self-loving, self-aware and she finally had the confidence to chase love  in stead of running away<br>Then, it&#39;s a process that has to be happened, Sun-oh is the first one made her heart warm and Hye-Yeong is the one made her wanna overcome her insecurity to feel his warmth<br>The triple all grown and find their peace after such an memorable journey
