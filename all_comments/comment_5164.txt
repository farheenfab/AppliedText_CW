K guys, some are disappointed  but I am definitely on the side that wasntðŸ˜Š. I love it haha. Let me share my POV. Since S1 i was already rooting for Hyeyeong, even though we all thought that the main lead she will end up with was suho. Still i was really drawn to that kind of love Hyeyeong showed (and maybe because im a sucker for 2nd lead&#39;s persona thats too good to be trueðŸ˜‚)<br>But seeing the ending of S1 &amp; coming S2, i was hopeful it might take a diff direction.<br><br><br>As i&#39;ve observed, the love story of Suho &amp; Jojo was based on a whirlwind romance where two broken people find comfort in each other while trying to escape the harsh reality of life. Whereas for Hye-young&#39;s &amp; Jojo&#39;s love story was a slow burn romance, two grown up people who find strength in each other while  facing the struggles of life together. <br><br>I like Hye-young steadfast love towards Jojo. How patient, understanding, caring, sincere &amp; selfless he has always been when comes to her. <br>And if u come to think of it, if she ends up with suho,In suho&#39;s world where his dad is a politician &amp; in the celebrity industry he works at cant u imagine the hard life she&#39;ll face?<br>Im not saying their love(if they choose each other) couldn&#39;t conquer all this obstacle. But witnessing what she went through as a child &amp; all those hardships while growing up makes me wanna spare her from all that super drama life &amp; let her live simply &amp; quietly with the one she loves without people meddling in between them. <br><br>Soo if the intended direction of the whole production of love alarm S2 is to portray a matured kind of love then i&#39;ll say well done, it was relayed successfully... at least for meðŸ˜‰
