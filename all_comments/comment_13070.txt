to be honest i dont even know why y’all are mad on why there is even a team sun-oh, i know how he kind of a jerk in the webtoon, but in this netflix series, he literally is so genuine. i understand how you all like hyeyeong because he really deserved so much, but pls understand too how sun-oh approach hyeyeong if he likes jojo bc he, himself is already falling on his own trick (which is kissing jojo to make hyeyeong jealous and to confirm if he really likes her, but still hye denied), in short, he also fell inlove with her. both boys showed different ways of love, hyeyeong’s love is pure and still constantly loving her even tho she doesn’t like her and that is really so touching because man, thats true love! but u also can’t deny how sun-oh genuinely loves jojo too to the fact that he’s there when he needed him the most (the runaway scene of jojo from their home, like she’s having panic attacks and then when she lifted her head there is sun-oh smiling at her) she also gave comfort to jojo, make her happy. and what i don’t like about their separation is the way they didn’t even have any quarrels, jojo just broke up w sun-oh like that.. without giving him any reason. imagine, saying to a guy “i like you” and then suddenly you’ll broke up w him and tell him, you doesn’t like him anymore. lmao wtf right? but sun-oh didn’t gave up still but jojo keeps pushing him away. in the present time he still can’t deny his feelings for her, even though she hurt him so much, she still rings her love alarm. and that is why i am still rooting for them. the way they made  my heart fluttered on season 1, i can’t accept if they won’t be together.. that’s just sad. but that doesn’t mean i am invalidating hyeyeong’s, yes he deserved it too, but i am just- rooting for sun oh and stating my reasons why i love his character too because i can’t understand why they are so mad @ sun-oh’s character and its not about the actor, its not about song kang why we love sun oh. even tho you switch the actors, like jung garam would be playing the role of sun-oh, i will still choose sun-oh. this is how i prove that it is nothing to do with the actors, in fact jung garam is really handsome too lol so dont act like we like sun oh just bc its song kang. song kang and jung garam is both so damn handsome though!!! 🥲
