I’m pretty sure she broke up with him because she didn’t want to get heart broken . She wanted to protect her heart. She tried to see sunho after the accident but there were things preventing her.. plus his parents wanted to send him to America if he kept getting in trouble I guess she didn’t want to be the reason ... and then she would be alone and heartbroken...🤷🏾‍♀️ “”” ❤️team sunho❤️ she’s kinda dumb if she’s relying on the app to tell her who she likes.. I hope sunho finds out her love alarm is shielded ... or she’s able to override the love alarm
