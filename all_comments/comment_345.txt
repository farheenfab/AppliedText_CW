Sun Oh was so straight forward. He saw the girl, fell for her and did everything to let her know that he was into her. He was always honest and brought his whole heart into this relationship. Whenever she was in pain he was there. Hye-Yeong on the other hand loved her in the dark. He followed her just to make sure she is safe. She never noticed him even though they worked together. She was clearly not interested. Sun-Oh asked Hye-Yeong a couple of times if he was also into Kim Jojo and he always denied it. My point is Hye-Yeong had the chance to get the girl but he never ever made the first move. He just waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile Sun-Oh and Kim Jojo got together, they kissed and laughed. Her feelings towards him got so deep that she broke up with him just to protect herself from getting hurt. 4 years passed and they both met on a crowded place where Kim Jojo only had eyes for Sun-Oh, she didn&#39;t even notice Hye-Yeong. AGAIN! So he started to follow her day after day even though she was the ex of his best friend. He put her over his long-lasting friendship. In my opinion he isn&#39;t  husband material. He had the chance to be with Kim Jojo long before Sun-Oh and he decided to fight for her after she was with his best friend. And don&#39;t get me started with Kim Jojo. There are plenty of men in Korea and she chose the only real friend Sun-Oh had. Naah, I don&#39;t buy the whole plot of season 2.
