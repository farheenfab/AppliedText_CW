I&#39;ve been a huge fan of this just like everybody else. I hope you the crew understand that you did your worst to destroy a part of me for the last 2 years. You brought us a show of two typical people in love (fall in love, meet up at the end of the day, walk home together...) alongside the somber male lead and that&#39;s everything. I stopped at ep.4. This has been the worst thing I&#39;ve seen so far this year.
