I&#39;m actually quite glad Jojo ended up with Hye-yeong. Not many people would agree with me but I actually thought it was a beautiful romance between them. It made me mad when Jojo took so long to tell Sun-Oh tho!!! Season 2 wasn&#39;t as good as Season 1 either but I did like the change they tried to make. Idk, it&#39;s just my opinion so  please be respectful:)
