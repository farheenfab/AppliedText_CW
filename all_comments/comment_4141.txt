I wish they could have explored a little more into the suicides and the love alarm killer. I also thought they would delve a little more into Hye-yeong&#39;s father and how that could affect the relationship. I am happy that Jojo chose hye-yeong because she fell in love with him gradually. She fell out of love with Sun-ho but couldn&#39;t verify it because she was afraid.<br>Also what more reason does she need to end things with Sun-ho than she doesn&#39;t love him. Once she matured and sorted out her feelings, she knew it was Hye-yeong she wanted and loved, regardless of what anyone else wanted.
