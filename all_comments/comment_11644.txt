I am only watching this if she chooses sun-oh . Otherwise it&#39;s a waste of my time . Why is she running away from him and hurting him so much . Poor thing . She should be honest with herself and him . What did he do wrong to deserve this treatment . She is toying around  with two people ðŸ™„ . And ultimately hurting both as seen in this  trailer .
