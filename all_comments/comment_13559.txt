To why Sunoh gets a lot of support, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of my personal experience or what but, liking a person and deciding to keep it a secret won&#39;t get you anywhere, let alone telling others that you don&#39;t like them, yes Sunoh going after Jojo even when he knows Hyeyoung likes her is selfish, but not allowing others to go for her because you like her when all you do is secretly admire instead of actually try will also be selfish. I personally like Sunoh because he likes her and he actually do something about it.<br>But anyway, whoever it is, I just hope she won&#39;t suffer anymore, girl has had enough last season.<br><br>Pardon my incorrect grammar English is not my first language.
