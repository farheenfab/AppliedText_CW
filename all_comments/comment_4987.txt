[SPOILER ALERT]<br><br>Deep in my heart, I think I knew that Jojo and Hyeyoung was the endgame after that dreamy bridge scene from S1. When they were gazing so intensely at each other, while the snow fell around them and Blooming Story played in the bg. That scene was what made Love Alarm so special to me, even when I&#39;m in team Sun-oh. HAHA<br><br>Not all fans would understand why the story ended the way it did, but I think it was good. Many K-dramas before had shown that the leading men with their rollercoaster of emotions and cool auras (i.e. Sun-oh) always get the girl in the end. And we loved them all because (obviously) they&#39;re every girl&#39;s dream guy. <br><br>But, what these shows don&#39;t tell us is that in reality, we should be with someone who brings calmness to our lives; someone who cares for us and listens to us, and loves us on our worst days. I cried so hard during the final ep bc after a lifetime of trauma, Jojo finally has someone as gentle as Hyeyoung. She needed someone as gentle as Hyeyoung. This drama wasn&#39;t the greatest, but I appreciate the story they told.
