Honestly I want every character to be happy. Especially jo jo. The most important thing is traumatized cuz of her incident in childhood. She don&#39;t have parents to support her. She have toxic aunt and cousin. She has to work hard to pay her tuition fees and take care of her grandma. Can she even think of love in that situation? She don&#39;t want sun oh or her to get hurt cuz of sun oh parents and she feels so small(him paying fee for her this and that) cuz she is in love with him. Ppl are complaining about jo jo character saying she is so irritating, just cuz she broke up with sun oh and made sun oh cry. Hye yeong and jo jo shares similar feelings more like he can understand her situation. Still hye yeong is the one who liked jo jo. Now sun oh is in relationship with other girl which made things even more complicated now. I hope jo jo - hye yeong endgame. Cuz he deserves. ‚ù§
