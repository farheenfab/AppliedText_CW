i really feel bad for hye-young he is still hoping that jojo will fall for him someday..girl jojo you know very well what you feel why give my man false hope...T_T tell him the truth i mean yeah it will hurt but i cant see him hoping for something which, he will never get..after watching so many dramas i dont expect jojo will end up with hye-young instead of su-noh..that aint happening
