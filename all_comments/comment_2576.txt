Kim Jojo is a damaged, self centered , selfish, control freak . She’s weak as in letting someone kissed her , fell in love with a person she bonded but switched to an easy target so she’s in control . I pity both guys and really don’t know what they see in her . If in real life she first need to see a shrink . Her past is going to plague her for life
