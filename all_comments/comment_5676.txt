I hope that she doesn’t end up with sun-oh. I know you’re all going to bash me for saying this but I honestly hope she doesn’t. If you’re hoping for that type of romance, just go watch “to all the boys I loved.” I hope this series is a series of growth and realization. I hope this series shows up something REAL. You don’t ALWAYS love the same person. You can learn to love someone else. It will make it different from other dramas. Not everyone gets their first love. Some people know better and realize a toxic relationship isn’t healthy.
