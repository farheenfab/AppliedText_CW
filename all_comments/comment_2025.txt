When I first started watching the show I first shipped her with sunoh but after few episodes they don’t make any sense in a way that sunoh was a weird creep who stalk a girl home and kissed her at the alley. It was freaking toxic bruh...I mean think realistically, if this happens in real life he’ll be so screwed. No matter if a guy is popular, rich or good looking, that is a big NO to do to a girl you’ve just met. Their chemistry was so rush. Also he was a real asshole to his bff Hye-young after he found out hye young also likes her for all those 4years. I mean sunoh fking kissed the girl Hye-young likes and Hye-young was matured enough to back off when jojo likes sunoh even though it was hurting him. Also I like how hye young handles things when a gay guy likes him. It was so mature and considerate of him to understand the other person without feeling disgusted. I could continue listing facts about why Hye-young is a better guy in reality if you really think hard about it. I’m not saying sunoh doesn’t love her. He loves her too but the way he handles the whole situation in the drama is a bit off putting. And besides he has a lovable gf now.
