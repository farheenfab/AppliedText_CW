I couldn&#39;t follow through this drama bc of this scene. Mans really went after the girl his best friend has a crush on...like??? Am I supposed to ship this? <br>I&#39;m not even saying his best friend has dibs bc I honestly hate the idea of a guy calling dibs on a girl just bc he saw her first (as if that guarantees he gets her) BUT there&#39;s such a thing as loyalty between friends and even if she doesn&#39;t like hyeyoung, sun oh shouldn&#39;t go after her. Go find you someone else weirdo. Smh I don&#39;t understand all these shippers...
