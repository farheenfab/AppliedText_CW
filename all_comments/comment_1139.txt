But to be honest, I kind of wish love alarm was an actual thing. Specifically love alarm 2.0. It tells you who won&#39;t ring your alarm. I wanna know if my crush won&#39;t ring my alarm or not. <br><br>This Kdrama reminds me of how lonely and single I am. I have been single all my life and I want to feel that affection from someone I love in a way I love my crush. My crush on the guy is so big for me, so I am really curious if he will ring mine.<br><br>I also hope that Jojo will pick Sunho in season 2. It breaks my heart that Hyeyeon has to be heartbroken like that, but Sunho was confident enough to make the first move, so Jojo ended up falling for Sunoh. I hate how Jojo is purposely pushing Sunho away from her, despite the fact that you can tell she still loves him and he still loves her. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do if she chooses Hyeyeon. I love him and all but he just isn&#39;t for her. I hope she makes the right decision for herself and chooses Sunho. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunho">#TeamSunho</a>
