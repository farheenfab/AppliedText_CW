damn when sun oh shouted “i know you still like me” i remember the scene “pls love me again pls” 😭<br><br>I don&#39;t get it. They let us fall soooo hard for this couple and left us with a teaser where jojo looks so happy with hyeyeong? I just hope this time she will fall in love again with Sun Oh so she can clarify all the things she has done in the past and explains why she needed to do that. With just only 6 episodes, I just hope they won&#39;t leave us hanging and pls if jojo will end up with sun oh pls pls give hyeyeong an happy ending he deserves. He is so sincere like guys like that doesn&#39;t even exist in real life
