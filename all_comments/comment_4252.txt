Bruh what made me pissed was the fact that if she didn’t had the shield the alarm would ring for Sunoh it would have been more interesting if the spear was given to sunoh to break the shield but all that nonsense with the other guy was just too forced like it’s obvious she didn’t like him back so why make all those pointless Scenarios ( his dad was in jail what what 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️) can’t believe I had to wait for 2 year for this mxmmmm
