SPOILER ALERT<br>I&#39;m here after finishing Love Alarm season 2 T.T<br>I really would have liked Jojo ending up with Sun Oh, they shared their first love story together and grew their feelings until that incident.... I still cheer up for them being together, but I understand that with this kind of story maybe her getting with Hyeyeong at the end suits better because they give us an example of how technology shouldn&#39;t influence us and dictate our feelings.
