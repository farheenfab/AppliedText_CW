First season was really good.. I still love that but the second neither I nor any of my friends liked it as it was very toxic and disgusting.<br>JoJo&#39;s miserable childhood was shown again and again just to gain sympathy and cover up her selfishness... How could she do that sun oh just like that and start dating hye young. JoJo&#39;s character really gives a bad vibe like be into several relationships and anytime without any reason you can leave them and hurt them and show a don&#39;t care attitude... and then find someone new to fall in love with... she first dumps her boyfriend then sun oh and never gave him an explanation inspite of Sun oh begging her several times... It seems like if few more seasons were there she would dump hye young too.<br>There&#39;s nothing wrong in being into several relationships but there should be some reason for breaking up with someone who showers so much love... I don&#39;t understand what was tried to show by Jojo dumping her boyfriends without any reason and most of the time lying to everyone... What will the teenagers learn from these type of dramas?!
