First of all i waited for season 2 since 2019.. i regret watching it tbh cause the ending was kinda messed up idek why kim jojo broke up with sun oh? i mean he didn&#39;t do anything.. she&#39;s the one who dumped him in the first place cuz it was ✨better for both of them✨ and she treated him in season 2 like he is the one who ruined the whole thing. Hye yeong had a good personality but he didn&#39;t do anything special for jojo. Sun oh didn&#39;t deserve this ending and fk the webtoon i literally spent 6 hours watching this and wasted my time
