So this is my first Kdrama.This show popped up in my recommendation on netflix (probably because I watch anime and foreign shows) and I decided to watch it. So I just finished it couple minutes ago and I am satisfy with the ending. Then I came here and read the comments and find many are upset. I might be in the minority here as a guy and also someone who liked the ending. Here are my opinions:<br><br>I will admit, in the first ep of the show I was not a fan of Sunoh since he knew Hyeyeong was in love with Jojo, even if he never admitted it (for godsake how can you chase after a girl your friend like?). He pulled up in his car and saw the way how Hyeyeong was admiring Jojo. However, as the 1st season progress and Jojo and Sunoh relationship developed I was ok with it. However, I felt sorry for hyeyeong because he was still in love with her and he even made some sacrifices in deleted the app and even tried to help Jojo into Sunoh home to talk with him. So yeah when the fortune turned to Hyeyeong in S2 I was happy because he liked her since the beginning of the show.
