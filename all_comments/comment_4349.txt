Spoilers ahead! Im so disappointed with the second season the chemistry between hye young and kim jojo was soo off and I would feel so bored watching them two and was literally waiting for sun oh&#39;s scenes because he was just a more interesting character to me. Gulmi carried the show tbh I loved watching her, she was such a fun interesting realistic character. Overall the second season was all over the place and not just because I don&#39;t ship hye young and jojo. It was also because of the pacing of the show etc.
