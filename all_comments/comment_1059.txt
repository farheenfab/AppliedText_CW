At one point I HATE Sun Oh because in these scenes he acts like a brat who just goes around to Kiss a girl with a boyfriend And Is just an asshole honestly.<br><br>On the other hand seeing him how after all the time he loves Jojo and he wasn&#39;t just like this for some Fun out of it but bcs he loves her makes me wanna hug him.<br><br>Sun Oh is kinda complicated...<br><br>Sometimes I wonder if he isn&#39;t a girl because these action swings remind me of me on my period.
