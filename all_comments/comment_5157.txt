Honestly I&#39;m 40 mins away from the end and I want her to end up alone. I cannot stand nor understand this character. Both guys are too good for her and it saddens me that their friendship is ruined because they both like her. I want both of them to walk away, but based on the webtoon I already know who&#39;s endgame.
