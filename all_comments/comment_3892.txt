I JUST STARTED AND FINISHED LOVE ALARM 2 TODAY AND OMGOSH! I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND THE HATE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL SERIES! A MUST WATCH TO EVERYONE WHO HAVEN&#39;T WATCHED IT YET!!<br>   First of all, Kim Jojo choosing HyeYeong over SunOh is not everything about the series. I understand the hype between them since SunOh and Jojo has more scenes on season 1 compared to HyeYeong and Jojo. But if you watch from the beginning without pre-hating the ending, you will truly understand why Jojo chose HyeYeong! And come on, if Jojo and SunOh ends up together, then what about HyeYeong and Yukjo who both waited YEARS just for their love to be reciprocated? This series gave every character a happy ending!<br>    Second, this story depicts a love story in real life. No overly-cringey dialogues, unreasonable promises, and overacting expressions, just REALITY.<br>    Third, the actions of the characters are also for REAL. How people who truly love can wait no matter what, how a child get disappointed because his father is nothing like him in reality after finally meeting him but lived his life trying to be good because himself is his mirror to his dad whom he never met, how people gets confuse over how they truly felt even if those feelings are so obvious for others to see, how people do everything just to achieve what they want, how some people obsesses over their belief on their self-made savior and that sometimes people misinterpret the artistic way of an artist on expressing themselves (The Ringing World), how we sometimes try to own and further develop something that we didn&#39;t make,  how some people&#39;s feelings never change, how self-abusive mom decides to change for her child/ren, how broken people gets to move on because both the parties involved decides to talk without shouting and listen without only choosing what they want to hear, and lastly, Jojo&#39;s decision to choose HyeYeong (LOVE) and Yukjo&#39;s decision to accept SunOh once again (LOVE).<br>   Lastly, the OST is SOOOO on-point, the actors and actresses all did an AMAZING job on their characters, the shots are REALLY great, and YES! tears and snots do come out so prepare tissues! And don&#39;t even mention chemistry, it&#39;s so heart fluttering ðŸ¦‹ðŸŒ¼<br>  Overall, Love Alarm Season 2 gives off a very serene atmosphere and is a perfect depiction of how love will look like if an app like Love Alarm exists. It also shows that somehow, saying &#39;I love you&#39; personally is more beautiful to hear than a ringing sound from the phone showing a message with the same letters.<br>   ANYWAY, WATCH IT TO FIND OUT WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT! YOU WON&#39;T REGRET IT!
