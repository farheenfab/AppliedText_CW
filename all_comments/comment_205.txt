HY did not approach to confess his love was because she was in relationship with another guy &amp; he respected her relationship &amp; left them alone but admired her from afar but SH said you don’t have to be happy to be in a relationship. He did not even respect that she’s in relationship. Am so glad she ended up with HY! Her true fated love &amp; she can easily open up to him until like SH she bottles up her emotions. She’s not an immature teenager anymore but was able to gradually come know what real true love is.  I enjoyed both seasons. <br><br><br><br>M
