I blame it all to her cousin, why was she so shlttyy??? like tf is wrong with her?? if only she wasn&#39;t like that and not treat duk gu badly and turned him down respectfully or letting him know she&#39;s uncomfortable of others following her or taking videos of her then Duk Gu wouldn&#39;t pity side with Hye Yeong. at the end we see him pity HY not getting his love reciprocated so he made that shield to block Jojo&#39;s feelings making her take rash decisions that only hurt her and Sun Oh. that fckking shield really UGHHH.  AND HYEYEONG WAS NEVER HONEST especially to Sun OH wtf, he always seemed pretentious around everyone except Jojo that&#39;s probably why we had his father arc. Jojo, what she really deserved was a better family/guardian/cousin, she didn&#39;t deserve sun oh so I&#39;m okay with her not choosing him but she should have explained!! this show is messed up honestly and it would&#39;ve been better if I had never known
