Sun oh is her first love, perfect, so romantic, but people grow up, and hye yeong loves and respect her, Sun-oh is more focused in show that she love him, he is not worried about what happen to her...Nobody is with her/his first love, because is not perfect, get over it. I want an happy ending for Sun-oh but with a person who really wants to be with him, and I hope Jojo learn to open up about her feelings with the patience and care of hye yeong ❤️
