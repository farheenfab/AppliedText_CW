Honestly I felt JoJo didn&#39;t deserve anyone. Son Oh didn&#39;t do anything to be treated like that, twice... And Hye-Yeong I honestly felt he should&#39;ve left her alone when he knew his friend was in love with her. But their love triangle is what made it a drama. <br><br>I preferred her with Son-Oh. It felt like she was in love. With Hye-Yeong it looked like she settled but I guess we&#39;ll see what happens in Season 3...
