AJWJWJJE FINALLY! Honestly speaking tho, I REALLY REALLY want JoJo to end up with Sun Oh. Sun Oh started from trying to use her to make Hye Young admit his feelings or sumt like that to actually genuinely loving her. Like if they won&#39;t end up in the end, ATLEAST tell him the real reason why you broke up with him JoJo! I&#39;m sorry I will cry if they don&#39;t end up together but yall I do love Hye Young too. He really likes her so I hope he finds his own happiness in the end.<br><br>I&#39;LL BE WAITING FOR MARCH
