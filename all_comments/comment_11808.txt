Hye-yeong deserves everything.. I hate sun-ho character for so many reasons.. hye-yeong is mature guy even he know his best friend kissed a girl whom he like even after he knew everything, hye-yeong didn&#39;t say anything and sun-ho knew that his best friend has a crush on her he still follow her , kissed her.. I hate this character from the beginning.. I hope she ended up with gentle guy
