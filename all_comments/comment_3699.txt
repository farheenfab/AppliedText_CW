It&#39;s not that sun-oh is more attractive so he deserves Jojo. I think the reason of breaking up with sun -oh was meaningless. Sun-oh was first whom Jojo really loved. I really like hye yeong but still that heartbreak Sun-oh faced is unbearable(In my opinion but gotta admit that drama is awesome!!)
