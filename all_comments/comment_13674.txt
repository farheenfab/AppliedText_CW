I&#39;m Team Hye-yeong. He deserves to be happy just as much as Jojo and Sun-oh. However, I&#39;m ok if he doesn&#39;t end up with Jojo. Why? Because Jojo is not obligated to choose Hye-yeong. If she likes Sun-oh, then we can&#39;t blame her. If she likes Hye-yeong, then likewise. It&#39;s Jojo&#39;s decision, always. I&#39;m Team Hye-yeong not (mainly) because he deserves to be Jojo&#39;s. I&#39;m Team Hye-yeong because I want him to end up with someone whom he chose and continuously chooses to love, and that who also chooses to love him back. Hye-yeong doesn&#39;t deserve to be just an option. They all deserve to be happy, but I&#39;m rooting for Hye-yeong the most. And the people who keep on saying that Hye-yeong should&#39;ve confessed to Jojo even before Sun-oh kissed her DON&#39;T HAVE ANY RESPECT TO RELATIONSHIPS AND THE BOUNDARIES YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN. LOL ARE YOU PROUD HOMEWRECKERS???
