This the most stupid and childish kdrama I&#39;ve ever seen....season1 was ok but season2 is beyond bad and boring. She broke up with sunoh because of her dumb unreasonable past thinking she should&#39;ve died with her parent in that family S.U.I.C.I.D.E, bringing pain to sunho and her insecure but forced herself to like hye young???....so she afraid to put sunho in pain because she likes him but aint give any thought about forcing herself to like hye young???!! Stupid enough she activated the shield and the spear to force her wills and doubt her feelings to who she really likes....I&#39;m like BITCH!!!! follow ur heart. If u like sunho and he likes u back then stay together. I would liked it more if sunho parent disapproved their relationship due to his father politic, election, not wanting scandals about their son dating poor girl and told her to breakup or if she accidently killed her parent.....etc because thats what I thought when her cousin mentioned her killed her parent but NO! her parent commit a mass family and she survived. Both girls in the show are stupid af...explained why they&#39;re cousins. This show just encourage people to facepalm their phones and shows that fame digger is real..yea u hate duk gu until u found out who he really is...no joke &quot;Temperature of Love&quot; and this show are the shittest kdrama in my 10yrs+ of kdrama watching.
