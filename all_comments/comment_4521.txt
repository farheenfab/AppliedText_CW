<b>SPOILER ALERT</b><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m really, really, REALLY dissapointed with the ending... But it may be hard to accept, the ending was actually right. It takes a mature person to understand the ending. Love Alarm may not exist today but it is true that people rely on technology too much, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprise if it will happen in the future. You see love is all about effort which Hye Hyung did in the first and second season, but Suh Oh relied on  the Love Alarm and got confident, and never really thought Jojo would change. This broke the typical love triangle story where the girl always end up with the main lead (or is there even a main lead in this drama) and that is a very risky move, not all people would get that, I really dont want to understand it but this is a very realistic story and this could happen in real life. My only problem though is if their planning to make Jojo and Hye Hyun end up together even from the start (Cuz I didnt know the webtoon) then they should have hinted it from the first season then the fans wouldn&#39;t be this heart broken.
