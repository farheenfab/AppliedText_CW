sun-oh deserves SO MUCH BETTER !!! I get she was trying to protect him by using the shield but at the same time it hurt him so much. PLUS the day before she said I love you and then all of a sudden she was like I donâ€™t like you anymore. Like she continues to play with his feelings and he keeps going for her. Itâ€™s actually so heartbreaking ðŸ˜­
