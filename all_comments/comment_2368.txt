im sorry no offense but jojo is a b$tch. first she breaks his heart coz she loves him &quot;too much&quot; and SHE doesn&#39;t want to get hurt so puts up the shield and then moved on so easily ???  she literally played with both the boys especially sunho hurting him in every way possible and then has a happy ending with hyeyeong? nah im not buying it glad i stopped watching s2 after ep1.
