I stop watching s2 halfway. I feel like it all went wrong. I mean they are good before then suddenly jojo decide its better off without her with no explanation to sun oh. And he had to live with such unhappy life. I feel its unfair. The least u can do is to give him proper closure. And to make it worst she fall with his bestfriend. And now sun oh literally lost everything. I dont get it. This is the worst plot ever
