This so sad, i’m so upset about the ending from season 2. This drama is really well made, loved season 1 so much and i was waiting of season 2 such a long time like all the other people. I waited and wanted to see Sun Oh and Jojo ending!!! I think i can’t handle watching season 2. Couldn’t finish Start Up too. I actually thought all the time Sun Oh is the lead. Second lead syndrom is so reallll omgsh!!! Why why why
