I still loved it and it&#39;s meaningful but the turn off about this season is the execution of events (everything is way complicated and rushed) and how everything made it so unclear for two guys esp. for Sun Oh who waited for a proper explanation so that he could move forward. I thought he just got stuck with his first love and can&#39;t love Yuk Jo back bcoz he had lots of questions for four years, thus making him unable to move on for real. Jojo didn&#39;t explain her side clearly to him. In the first season, I didn&#39;t like Sun Oh&#39;s character, but in this season, can&#39;t help to feel so bad for him. Above all,  I felt so so so bad for Yuk Jo among the characters here T^T <br><br>What&#39;s more is that Jojo didn&#39;t understand herself why she desparately used the spear feature just to ring Hyeyeong&#39;s love alarm, which made Hyeyeong get confused and made him question her sincerity to him. She said herself that she wants to get rid of the shield bcoz of Hyeyeong so she should understand better and let Hyeyeong understand her real motive. Jojo wasn&#39;t able to come up with her inner conflicts until Duk Gu came just to give a good and sensible explanation to her and Hyeyeong ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ And what lacks about this season is the character behind Duk Gu and his story with Gul Mi. End game aside, everybody is curious about Duk Gu but the film didn&#39;t show him that much.<br><br>Though genre and message wise, this isn&#39;t a typical love story and I like it. This drama is all about overcoming anxiety and the impact of social media and technology to everyone&#39;s life.<br><br>Without looking at the actors and just focus on the characters, the season 2 delivered what it is to love without the reliability of the Love Alarm app (since the girl can&#39;t ring either of the two guys&#39; love alarm bcoz of the shield). The girl ending with the fine and understanding man who respected her, didn&#39;t touch (kiss) her, and courted her until she could finally say that she loves him, is much better.<br><br>If you guys can&#39;t appreciate Jung Ga Ram (Hye Yeong), just appreciate the maturity of his character in the film and also the beautiful message behind this series. It&#39;s not just bcoz Song Kang (Sun Oh) has better chemistry with the girl and is more handsome (and he suffered &quot;more&quot;, they said), he would be the one. Remember, it takes a good foundation and maturity for a relationship to become pure and strong and that&#39;s what Hyeyeong x Jojo portrayed in this season. It&#39;s not all about the sudden feelings and &quot;kilig&quot;, it&#39;s all about patience and understanding each other&#39;s feelings which both Sun Oh and Jojo failed to do when they were together. Jojo felt so inferior and Sun Oh failed to see that. Sun Oh just hated Jojo and didn&#39;t patiently work out his feelings and waited when Jojo did not ring his love alarm anymore (which Hyeyeong did even though he did not receive even a single ring from the beginning). Their relationship started as just selfish feelings of lust and infatuation.<br><br>Ratings: 4.0
