I&#39;m asking why in the last episode first season she went to find Sun Oh. Now in this season I feel she&#39; end up with Hye Young. This is confusing.... Hye Young is loyal. But remember Hye Young had his opportunity to be sincere about his feelings but he decided to hide it from the start. But what about Sun Oh? He&#39;s the one who suffered the most. I just want Sun Oh to be happy tbh. But my guts are telling me it&#39;s gonna be JoJo and Hye Young smh.
