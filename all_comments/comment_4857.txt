Having binge watched love alarm season 1 and 2 in all in one go I have so many thoughts..<br><br>1. Jojo was never truly honest about her feelings, even until the very end. She played with her words constantly which kept Sun-o never able to get the closure he needed. When her memory was in the school and it led her to the room Sun-O was in. When she kissed Sun-o in the second season and she disappeared from Hye-Youngs &quot;people who will love you&quot; list, how does that happen if she doesn&#39;t still care for Sun-O? After she uses her spear and going into college the next day. Her friend says to her she thought she would have been happier, she reply&#39;s it&#39;ll take some time to get used too. The tape played at the end showing her love alarm log only showed times hye-young had set her alarm off, not the times Sun-O had set it off also?..<br><br>2. I&#39;m still a little confused as to why she felt the need to use the shield in the first place. She only finally installed it after she heard his parents talking about sending him away if he got in trouble again and hearing people blaming her for the bike accident. So Was it because she was worried about herself getting hurt, or was she scared of hurting Sun-O (like she blamed herself because of her parents). <br><br>3. At the end Guk-du shows an app he&#39;s working on that detects when someone is lying.. Could this be a hint for season 3? Will her feelings be caught out if hye-young was to ask if she still loved Sun-O? She only ever had one spear, what&#39;s to say she doesn&#39;t love them both?<br><br>4. Sun-ho&#39;s love alarm still hasn&#39;t rung for anyone else so there&#39;s still hope they&#39;re holding this out for another season üôèüèº??<br><br>Whilst this story was never just about love, it was about jojo overcoming her childhood trauma and understanding to forgive herself and allow herself to be loved. Also about people obsession with technology and relying on likes to feel worthy. This is where hye-young were so different from Sun-O. Sun-O felt the love alarm ringing was the only way to know he was loved, where Hue-young understood about it needing to be natural and the patience of love.<br><br>Whilst both their reasons for loving her we&#39;re different, they were both still love. üíî
