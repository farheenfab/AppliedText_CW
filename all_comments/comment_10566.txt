After waiting whole 2 years and a cancelled release I was really mad but know the trailer is here I&#39;m really grateful but guilty at the same time cuz we all know jojo will end up with hye yeong cuz of the trailer. But It&#39;s fine cuz True Beauty has a S2 and there&#39;s a chance that seojun will have a big chance!!! but if I already know that sunho will not end up with jojo I might not continue watching the drama even waiting for 2 years.
