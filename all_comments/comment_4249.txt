I must be the only one who enjoyed the ending lol Sun-oh relied to much on the app and almost felt controlling to me. &quot;I know you&#39;ll love me cause you will ring my love alarm.&quot; But not listening to her when she tells him she doesn&#39;t love him. You guys also relied to much on the love alarm thinking she loved Sun-oh. Also... what do you guys have against Hye-yeong?!?
