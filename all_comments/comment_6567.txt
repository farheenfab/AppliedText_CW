Ik most ppl want jojo with sun-oh, but its actually very conflicting since hye-young has always been holding back bcs of sun-oh. And ik how painful it is to be sun-oh after being dumbed like tht but also imagine ur in hye-young&#39;s shoes, ur best fren stole your unrequited crush and you let it be bcs u care abt him more than yourself, i think thatd hurt the most. And im sure tht even tho he was kinda cowardly for not reaching her out sooner, but he was also holding back bcs if he did tht he&#39;d hurt sun-oh. And sun-oh decided to stop chasing her aka give her up so i dont get why he&#39;d stop hye-young from being happy, from the way he said it, it seems lyk hes stopping hye-young bcs he doesnt want her to hurt him like he did, if not then itd bcs its super weird for his ex to date his bff but  tht wud just be awkward , not hateful. Anyways i do ship jojo x sun-oh no matter how much i pity hye-young but either way itd be fine for me since itd hurt as much
