Listen here. Sunoh won&#39;t meet jojo if it&#39;s not because of hyeyeong, in my view point Hyeyeong deserve so much love. How can they just defend on that app, if jojo knows what her heart felt she will choose who she think her heart tells. I hope she follow her heart well and hyeyoung have a happy ending too. but yeah Love Alarm is focus on that app and that&#39;s what story all about. 2nd lead syndrome will always be the painful love story.
