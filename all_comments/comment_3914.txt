Damn I wish I read reviews before putting my time into this ðŸ˜‘ season 2 was just trash. Its completely different from s1 (which had a lot of potential), you can tell there are different writers. Ignoring the plot holes (and there are so so many), poor writing, lack of development, weird pacing, etc. It comes down to this - Hye-young and jojos romantic chemistry feels forced
