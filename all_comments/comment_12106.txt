I don&#39;t understand why people romanticizing Hye Young&#39;s one-sided crush, the girl not into him, and she&#39;s made it clear many times. The fact that he made jojo and Sun-ho break up. That is not what someone would do if he was a good guy. Hye young may not be mean to jojo but he&#39;s pushed someone important out of her life and made her upset so he can try and pursue her romantically that selfish and immature.
