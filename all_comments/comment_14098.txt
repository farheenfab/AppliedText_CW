Sunoh&#39;s version :<br>Jojo and sunoh would end up together bcs no matter what happen in the past, they still have a heart for each other. The other reason is sunoh looks like he never enjoy his life until he met jojo. So jojo was everything to him and the one who can make sunoh happy. And hyeyeong would end up alone bcs with or without jojo, he still can be happy. He also has mother who always support him.<br><br>Hyeyeong&#39;s version :<br>Jojo eventually likes hyeyeong bcs be realize that hyeyeong is so kind and his love is so genuine to her. And sunoh decide to move on and live his life like he used to be. He is trying to find his happiness. Or he open his heart for yukjo. <br><br>P.s It doesnt matter jojo will end up with. I just want a happy ending, especially for hyeyeong. He deserves it.
