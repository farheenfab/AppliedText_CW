its that only me that happy with the ending because jojo choose hyeyoung based on how him treated her and how hyeyoung still love jojo even though jojo doesnâ€™t ring the alarm compare sun oh that depend to love alarm to know that that her love him or not <br>if you love her trust your guts bruh<br>.<br>.<br>i think this is the first time korean drama that female main character is choose guy that deserves her compared to handsome , rich , bad , problem guy <br><br>just my own opinion ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
