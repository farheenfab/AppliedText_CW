I don&#39;t know why lot of ppl think that  jojo ended up with hye-yong rather than sun ho is better. sun ho truely loved her and he always wanted  be there for her in her hard times and and he is really a nice, kind hearted and sweet guy, i mean he&#39;s character is the best for me and the ending whould be the best if jojo ended up sun ho
