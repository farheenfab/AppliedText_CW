<b>QUOTING THIS LIKE-MINDED SENTIMENT FROM QUORA:</b><br><br><br><i>I don’t think Sun-oh is the logical choice, to me it would be Hye-yeong.</i><br><br><i>You see with the former it was passion, it was strong but there was jealousy and hurtful actions. It was something that marks you. But with Hye-yeong, i think it would be love, something peaceful. The difference btw love and passion is that in love there’s trust &amp; respect. Hye-yeong said it himself, if she rejects him he’ll go but Sun-oh never forgave Jojo for leaving he even went to make a fool of himself and Jojo in front of the entire school because he didn’t accept it. Passion can’t go on forever but love can last.</i><br><br><i>As you grow older you want to be happy and safe but with Sun-oh there would always be something in the way of that. So i think that as an adult Jojo would choose love over passion, it would make sense for her character to want something secure. Even though she still has feelings for Sun-oh, i think it would be interesting to see her grow closer to someone and eventually slowly developing feelings as it sometimes happens.</i><br><br><i>I’ll add that it doesn’t even need to be with Hye-yeong (it’s just bit more logical to think it should as he is one of the 2 love interests), i just think it would be a great character development for Jojo.</i> —Gerteude Wurst
