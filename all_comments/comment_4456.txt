Okay. First of all i waited long enough for the release of love alarm season 2 and then when it finally came. I expected so much in this new season which made us sooo lost at the ending of season 1. Then all of the sudden season 2 made us more LOST by kim jojos UNDECISIVE actions, getting 2 oppas cry and hurt each other. I was like expecting the 2 oppas (sun oh, hye yeong) be like brothers or besties again then sunoh and jojo will realize how they REALLY LOOOVE each other that no matter what obstacles, no matter how many people will judge them they still choose one another. Thats how i expected it to be. But Noooooooo. The ending sucks!!!!!!
