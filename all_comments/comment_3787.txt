Whatever may be it&#39;s a we took stroy or a orignal story, why the first love doesn&#39;t got a correct explanation...like still it happened 10months ago today my mom watched with me and asked me a single question like, how geniune the boy was he doesn&#39;t hurt her a single bit right,like most of them told in comments that,sun ho is the best pair I know but I want to ask a single question what was the Correct reason that she leave him and what was the reason that she chooses that second boy. Like she leave the first love for not to hurt her surroundings whatever may be ,I want a single reason why she left him and ended with his friend.if she want to love again she can choose sunho itself naahh, but she chooses him ok he is ok she like the second lead I accept honestly,but I want a reason why did he leave and I can honestly say that in imagination to there will be not a person like sunho but in end you told me that,true love doesn&#39;t get any positive ending in life.<br>Am not korean but am learning korean and am not telling you to hurt you but I want to clarify that, the perfect boy always gonna get hurt in end !!!!!! <br><br>MiahnaeðŸ’œ
