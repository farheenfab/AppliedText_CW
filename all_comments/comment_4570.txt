I felt cheated out of an happy ending. For me this was no happy ending (JoJo and Hye-young) My heart was all in for Hwang Sun-oh, I believe he was the only one who truly loved JoJo and was deeply hurt by both of them. I was hoping that he and JoJo would have found happiness In Season2 but  I realize the plot twist and I lost interest. I hated both JoJo and Hye-young for betraying Sun-Oh and in the end he had to settle for second best. I was disappointed really, that is a happy ending?  Some of you might say Hye-young loved her first but remember he denied liking JoJo to Sun-oh and a mighty fine friend he is! Betrayal, Used, Lies and dishonesty. THIS WAS NO HAPPY ENDING..100% DISAPPOINTED!
