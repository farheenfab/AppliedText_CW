Really love S2 Love alarm, cos so many loveable moments showing us the true n mature love relationship. Hye yeong character is the best green flag man exist n kdrama. Jung garam play the character perfectly. I really fall in love with him as well as Jojo. Really appreciate the writers to make the ending more realistic in our real life. A man like HY is the man we need to be with in our rest of life ‚ù§
