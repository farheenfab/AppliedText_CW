People saying they didn&#39;t like the ending because Jojo end up with Hyeyeong y&#39;all don&#39;t really understand it, right? U want Sun Oh to be with Jojo in the end because they look cute and sweet but that&#39;s not what relationship should be all about. You just don&#39;t want to understand the show, this season, all of you are just watching because of  romantic excitement between Sun Oh and Jojo but you don&#39;t understand their situation. For me, this show is beautiful. It teaches us so many things about relationships. Well done👏👏
