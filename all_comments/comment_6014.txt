Just finished season 1 and it messed up my feelings, to the point that I can&#39;t sleep.. What the heck, I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m feeling like this. Maybe it just made me realize how alone I am lol<br>I kinda wish I hadn&#39;t seen it, don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s an amazing drama but I don&#39;t like the feeling it left in me, did this happen to anybody else? Or am I just a weird loser?
