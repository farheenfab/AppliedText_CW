@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=66">1:06</a> Jojo &amp;HyeYeong holding hands 😳☺️HyeYeong who gave JoJo hope again! If he’s not end game then idk what else to say...And I’m sorry but what do you guys see in Sunoh? Just his looks? If so, y’all need to get pass that! He literally stole his best friend’s crush, kissed Jojo when he knew she had a boyfriend. And from the trailer... seems like he’ll be selfish till the very end. 🤷🏻‍♀️
