Ang daming twist sa plot ng story which is hindi siya masyadong konektado sa seanson 1 kaya na curious ako at first . pero in the first episode nagkaroon na ako ng hint kay jojo and hye-yeong kasi mas more kasi yong scene ni hye-yeong kesa kay sun-oh , but still im trying na e connect padin yong story sa season 1 pero still i dont get it . A little bit disappointed but we dont have any choice is to accept the ending kahit na masakit , it seems that jojo was very happy in season 1 . then pag ka season 2 i just saw in her eyes that she was sad . i dunno . the story is very sad mas maganda padin yong season 1 . share ko lang .
