Am I the only one rooting for Hye-yeon? Right from the start all he ever wanted was for Jojo to be happy. He gave way for Sun-oh because Jojo was happy with him, but now he&#39;s finally showing his love for Jojo, I just hope he doesn&#39;t get too much heartbreak this time, whether he gets the girl or not. <br><br>When Hye-yeon said &quot;I could wait for you, whatever you do, as long as that what&#39;s you feel.&quot; Man, that&#39;s just pure love. Right until the end, what matters for Hye-yeon was Jojo&#39;s happiness.
