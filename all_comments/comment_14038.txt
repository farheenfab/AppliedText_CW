What if Love Alarm 2 performs less than its predecessor, i.e. if they&#39;ll solely focus on this &quot;love triangle&quot; without even exploring the actual large-scale conflict from which the story began? Oh dear... I can&#39;t just imagine how disappointed will I become hahahaha<br><br>That&#39;s why I can&#39;t wait to watch it and see if it can maintain or reinforce the things which made Love Alarm 1 so popular and meaningful as a work of drama. I hope Love Alarm 2 goes well, or goes better. ðŸ˜Š<br><br>Edit: Many people are just obsessed to whether Jo-jo goes out with either Sun-oh or Hye-yeong... Is that what this story really is about? Or... (oh dear) Is this how Love Alarm 2 will turn out? ðŸ˜•
