HyeYoung and Jojo ending together because &quot;he waited&quot; for her...lol no, she never asked him to, he doesn&#39;t get her heart as an award for that. Will you marry a dude you didnt like before just cuz he waited for you to love him???? Not bueno for the guy. More than her ending with SunOh, she needs to sit down and tell him why she broke up with him, so he can move on. And he also needs to grow up, because my man it&#39;s being like 5 years, let it go. Jojo is with HyeYoung because he represents comfort and calmness, and she doesn&#39;t have to confront things, at least that&#39;s how it seemed at the end of S1, let&#39;s see if he changes in S2, I think he also needs to let go, learn to find his worth (he compared himself to SunOh, while SunOh was jealous he was so loved and he was just a rich kid). They all need to grow before actually being with anybody in a relationship. Truly, JoJo should be with somebody she has never known, and like somebody said, to decide for herself, not with the app (even my man HyeYoung did it, you can too lol)
