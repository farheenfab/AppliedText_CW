Why do immature Sun Oh fans try to invalidate her feelings because she used a spear? What could she do? She couldn’t remove her shield. And in the world they live in, ringing someone’s love alarm was basically telling them “I love you”. So she out of her own free will just chose to tell Hye Yeong “I love you”. It’s really not a hard concept to understand because this is what we have to do in the world we live in. People use “spears” everyday when they tell their significant other “I love you” or when they confess to their crush. <br><br>And guys even in their world, love alarm doesn’t really tell you who you like, love alarm does the job of telling the person that you like, that you like them. The creator made it because he didn’t have the courage to confess. He knew who he liked, he made the app to tell them. There seems to be a misconception for some people that it tells YOU who YOU like, no of course you know who you like, it’s to tell someone you like that you like them. So Jojo knew who she liked, but because of the shield, she wasn’t able to express it to Hye Yeong, so she used the spear.<br><br>The app just made it easier for people to confess, they no longer needed to work up the courage to spill out the words “I like you” or “I love you”, they didn’t have to say it or write it or really do anything besides walk closer to the one they like. That’s all love alarm was.
