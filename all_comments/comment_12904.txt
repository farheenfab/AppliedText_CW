This is coming from someone who actually read the webtoon. Jojo and Hyeyoung just makes sense. Jojo and Sunoh were brought together by the Love Alarm, whereas Jojo and Hyeyoung pursue a real relationship in the webtoon even when her Love Alarm doesn’t ring for anyone. Hyeyoung is the best character in the show/story because he doesn’t need a nonsensical app to show someone his love which is how it should be. I remember at point Jojo writes Hyeyeong a letter and she says “Hyeyeong, you’re the destination of my heart, where my lonely walk ends” and it really showed how much he meant to her.
