I really want sun oh and jojo to get together but this drama has really fked up plots and I think sheâ€™ll end up with hyeyoung<br><br>Reason 1<br>This is drama logic. Most dramas end this way. Sun oh will slowly let go of jojo and move on. Jojo and hye Young will end up together<br><br>Reason2<br>Jojo will choose Hye young because he only cared about others and he was very selfless.<br>Jojo and Hyeyoung are both lonely inside and they both meant for each other <br><br>Reason3<br>In the webtoon, sun oh rings the other girl( the blonde hair girl that he was dating ) for the first time and I guess they ended up together. The drama might follow the webtoon.<br><br>Reason4<br>Song Kang ( Sun oh ) stated in a interview that he thinks it will follow the webtoon<br><br>Remember this is a fcked up drama with fcked up plots so anything can happen but this will be more likely to happen.<br>Iâ€™m still praying day to day that this will not happen<br><br>TEAM SUN OH ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
