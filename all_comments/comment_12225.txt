Hye Yeong love her as an adults, he can do everything for JoJo but Sun Oh love as a kid, He believed in Love Alarm too much so when JoJo didn&#39;t ring his alarm, he started being crazy and become bad. Finally Sun Oh gave up his love by the easy way... So I think the directors will choose Hye Yeong to end up together with JoJo...<br>But please, I just want Sun Oh ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I cried so much at ss1 and now I don&#39;t want to cry anymore. Please !!!!
