Yall, I got it<br><br>Hye Yeong and Sun Oh bromance, that&#39;s all we need. We don&#39;t need any girl here, even if its Jojo. Like, I feel that Jojo needs to figure out her feelings and just herself in general. Like she needs to become a complete person with a good understanding of herself before she dates someone else. That, and I&#39;m just a big fan of bromance in general, which is why I tend to avoid love triangles usually (I mean, i didn&#39;t even watch The Vampire Diaries for the same reason). <br><br>But I do feel she&#39;ll end up with Hye Yeong (I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m right but i think that&#39;s how it is originally). I mean, the order of the cast names kind of suggests that too, like it went Jojo, HyeYeong and Sun Oh
