Currently watching the beginning S2E2. E1 was so annoying to watched because JoJo and Hye-Yeong have so many sweet moments. I didn&#39;t mind but it&#39;s so forceful. Like they really tried to make them have chemistry by having this sweet slow mo moments. But, nope. It turns out so forceful, cringe, and awkward to watched. I found out that she ends up Hye-Yeong. So, disappointed. I literally waited all this time just for this? And even cancelled my plans for the day. Ugh!
