<b>THANK YOU NETFLIX FOR THE ENDING I WAS WAITING FOOOOOR</b>  <br>Now after this beautiful ending and most logical one <b>and only possible one</b> I can finally add Love Alarm in my list of favorite kdramas <br>Hyeyeong has always been the first lead and Sunho the second lead, the writers just made Sunho look like the first lead male. <br>If it ended in the other way, I wouldn&#39;t have saved it as one of my favorite kdramas <br>And if there are people who still want Jojo to end up with Sunho, then they understood nothing about this kdrama
