I have nothing but love for both Hye Young and Sun Oh&#39;s characters, but when it comes to Jojo, I honestly believe that Hye Young was more right for her than Sun Oh. Hye Young was patient and took his time to show his feelings for Jojo, letting her come to him emotionally at her own pace. He was always there for her, even when she didn&#39;t know it, and always put her feelings first. I&#39;m glad he grew out of being a pushover with Sun Oh (even though I was saddened by the end of their friendship) and decided to pursue his heart, cus for the longest time, he always put himself second even when he encouraged others not to do so. We can&#39;t always control who we love, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible to choose WHO you love either, and I was so happy when Jojo chose him in the end. He deserved to be chosen for once. And plus, I always felt that Jojo was too reliant on the app to really understand why she felt the way that she felt. I do believe she loved Sun Oh, but there was also too much pain from that relationship for her to really comprehend why. She needed to break from him for herself, even if it wasn&#39;t done properly. Then again, trying to convince someone that you don&#39;t want to be with them and them not letting you leave because &quot;You still love me, the app said so&quot;... I always cringed at that. You can love someone and it still not be a good relationship to be in. Sometimes, it&#39;s even better to be apart from that person than in a relationship with them. <br><br>With regards to Sun Oh, I&#39;m also very glad that he ended up with Yuk Jo, cus he deserves someone who pays attention to and is patient with him. His app always rang because of people who were attracted to his looks, not who he is. I suspect that was why he couldn&#39;t fully love Yuk Jo in the beginning because of that idea. But overtime, he saw how confident she was in proving her love for him in her actions, not just through an app. She was always her own person with her own dreams, but she always acknowledged his needs and wants and always considered him in pretty much everything they did together. She never pushed, never tried to isolate him from others and always listened when he needed it. I&#39;m really happy with how they wrote her character, cus most of the time, love rivals would usually be like &quot;If I can&#39;t have him, then no one can.&quot; Not her. When he still loved Jojo, she was even mature enough to let him go, even when she still loved him.
