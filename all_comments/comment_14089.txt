Hye-yeong is too precious, Sun-oh wants to be loved (but I&#39;m kinda scared the way he yelled at her??), Jojo is a relatable character to me and she needs to be understand too because she&#39;s scared after what happened to her in the past which she is traumatized.<br><br>This show is so unrealistic because your determining your feelings through an app but I&#39;m still gonna watch it tho and I&#39;m curious to know who she ends up with. But I don&#39;t care who she ends up with as long both sides are happy, I&#39;m fine (I think) but I still need to be prepared.
