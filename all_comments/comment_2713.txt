I guess some people are really obsessed with this ship and it&#39;s supporters going around trying to downplay all the comments and personaly calling them names when they know nothing about them, shows how toxic some fans really are and proves what we have been saying over and over again, if you can&#39;t handle others opinions, just scroll past it and move on. Why do you feel the need to leave a comment when no one asked you and it&#39;s not needed especially if you&#39;re gonna openly disrespect others. Geez, the hypocrisy and ignorance is crazy.
