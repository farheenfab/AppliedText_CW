this is so disgusting, he knew that his BEST FRIEND liked Jojo and that she has a boyfriend but he still went ahead and kissed her I can&#39;t believe anyone really loves his character he&#39;s freakin&#39; fake. Hye- Yeong is way better, cause he liked her from the beginning but he respected that she was in a relationship with someone else. Sun- oh&#39;s feelings was lust not love
