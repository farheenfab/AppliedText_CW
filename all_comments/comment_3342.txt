this still so heartbreaking scene for me.. sun oh who clueless and doesnâ€™t know anything that jojoâ€™s will ends their relationship in the next day in school ðŸ˜­<br><br>in this case sunoh didnt make any mistake.. he was always there for her and genuinely wanted to make her happy. Kim jojoâ€™s inferiority complex and pressure from peers made her breakup with him in an unfair matter. in this case i think the only wrongful one is kim jojo. She hurt sun-oh just because she&#39;s scared of being hurt :(( poor sun oh
