The reason why this drama deserves an award is because it is not your usual kdrama where the best looking lead gets the girl. This story is about what mostly happens in real life. When I watched the first season I was surprised on how shallow the plot was considering that Kim Soohyun stars in it.. then I learned there was a sequel and now, here we are. The story is deeper than what it seemed in the first season. Season 2 is not just about the “Love Alarm” anymore. This is about freely choosing what you want without societal pressure, dictating what you can and cannot do. This is standing up to your past, and embracing your reality...
