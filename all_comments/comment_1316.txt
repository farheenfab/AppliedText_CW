TEAM HYE- HYEONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! For all of u that said he didn&#39;t have the courage to confess WTF!!! Hye-yeong respected that Jojo has a boyfriend, would u feel better if someone random  came and kissed your girlfriend just by having a eye contact moment with her WTH are you that easy.  People are so dumb these days!! But if you&#39;ve watched the whole S1 Hye-Yeong finally confessed to her when she was single that is what u call real man, unlike Sun-oh who kissed out of the blue, it was just lust, OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE. Nonetheless have a nice day. HYE-YEONG FIGHTING OPPA.
