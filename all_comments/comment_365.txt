Y’all are gonna hate me for saying this but Jojo’s relationship with Sun-oh was toxic. The first season was obviously a high school fling and the second season is where the characters matured are realized what true love is. Hye-young is such dream husband material, I mean he literally raised the standard for all men out there by showing Jojo what a sweet, patient, loving guy he is and people are having a fit because Jojo didn’t pick Sun-oh because he’s attractive? I mean he literally asked every episode, “You like me?” I don’t know about everyone else in the comments but looks can only go so far, personality is what matters the most.
