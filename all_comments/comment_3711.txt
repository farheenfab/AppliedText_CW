You know what, I can accept to a certain point that JoJo ends up with the other guy. <br>But the most painful part about season 2 is the suffering Sun-ho goes through. He is just hurting and miserable the entire time trying to get back the love of his life and at the end there is no closure, all his efforts were for nothing, all his pain was for nothing, he was forgotten and replaced for no good reason besides &quot;I was too imature back then&quot;. <br>It depresses me just imagining his pain.
