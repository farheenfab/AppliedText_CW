Honestly i found it so ridiculous that he said “You like me right?” after seeing her for,like, two times... flash forward I still find this whole scene extremely absurd (btw this has nothing to do with who ships who together) and the part he says “how did you know thunder would come after lightning?” And she says “It’s taught in middle school” and then he goes “I’m a model”  💀💀
