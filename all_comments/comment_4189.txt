I just completed watching love alarm season 2. I don&#39;t know why but I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the ending although it was pretty happy. everytime I saw Kim jojo with hye young I just thought of sun oh .I could never feel the relationship between them as I did with sun oh. Is it just me who isn&#39;t happy from the fact  that sun oh couldn&#39;t truly smile throughout the season and I wasn&#39;t not happy with how things ended. I know that it&#39;s just a drama but I still maybe don&#39;t have that satisfaction maybe bcz that&#39;s usually not how every story ends..
