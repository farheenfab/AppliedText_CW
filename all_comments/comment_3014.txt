As much as I loved Sun-oh, it was obvious that she downloaded the shield to protect herself from the pain. She took a while thinking about whether to download it or not after Duk-gu sent it to her. She knew that it was selfish but sometimes, you just got to be selfish for once. Then Hyeyeong came along. He seemed so safe to her that she wanted to lower her shield. That shield she built for protection was now something she wanted to take away just for him. Thatâ€™s why she downloaded the spear. For Hyeyeong. She downloaded the shield for Sun-oh and downloaded the spear for Hyeyeong. She wanted to hide her feelings from one while she wanted to show her feelings to the other.
