For ppl mad at jojo for breaking up .. the breakup actually makes sense-  <br>Jojo has a traumatizing past everyone she loved cared or had left her , she didn’t want to get too attached to sun oh cas not every relationship lasts long , sun oh isnt the Responsible type. do u think his mother would’ve easily accepted jojo?? Foreseeing the possibilities she didn’t want to take a risk (also let’s not forget she keeps on feeling smaller than him ) jojo deserves love warmth acceptance family that she never had !
