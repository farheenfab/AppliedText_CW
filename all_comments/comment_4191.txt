Fuck, I don&#39;t like this season at all, I like so hyun but sun oh didn&#39;t deserve that, he never forgot jojo, but this season shows that she never liked sun oh, her love wasn&#39;t real, I&#39;m so  disappointed with this chapter,  the author wanted to write something new so that it would not be repeated as always, but I think it broke.  Fucking ending!!!!
