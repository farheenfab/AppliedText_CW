OMG!!!!<br>Sun-oh: &quot;You still like me!&quot; and the me died :D<br><br>Seriously, I&#39;m hoping Jojo and Sun-oh being together ending. Why? In season 1 there was no 3rd party involved. It was purely Jojo left Sun-oh because of her self-pity and cannot win over herself state. It was unfair for Sun-oh to be left just like that. I hope season 2 will show some growth in the characters where Jojo will be able to win over herself and have the confidence to fully love Sun-oh. Though I&#39;m not saying Hyeyoung doesn&#39;t deserve to be loved. But, in the storyline from the beginning, he backed out due to a lot of reasons and some of them are similar to Jojo&#39;s reasoning in leaving Sun-oh. I&#39;m glad in season 2 there is a growth in his character where he got the courage to stand up for himself to run after his happiness. But I was introduced to a hanging romance from Sun-oh and Jojo. I need to see growth and I want to see a happy ending with both of them together overcoming their fears in season 1. Amen!!! Team Sun-oh hihihi :D
