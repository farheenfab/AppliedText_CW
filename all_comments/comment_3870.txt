What if he commit suicide for his failure...hye- young can take it easy but sun-oh can&#39;t.. such a stupid story , how could they end up the female lead with the second Male lead? Such an annoying story.. we&#39;ve saw many triangle love dramas at the end they&#39;ll end up the female lead with first lead.. there can be romantic involvements for female lead with both male leads but at last the story must be end up shippin female lead and first lead..! Love alarm is the stupid story i&#39;ve ever seen..!
