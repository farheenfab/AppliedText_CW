The story becomes senseless only when you realize that sun oh never did anything wrong and still waited for jojo but they changed the whole story line at the end. First we were made to fall in love with sun oh and his character and now we get a heartbreak. Please another season of this so they can actually meet jojo and sun oh.. It looked like they were meant for each other. Even at the end Sun oh never gave up on Jojo he said if I will be sad I will take care of myself it means that he is still willing to wait for her and want her back. The story would have been much better and more people would&#39;ve liked it if sun oh and jojo ended together
