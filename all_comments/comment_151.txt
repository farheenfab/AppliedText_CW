I don&#39;t know why I wanted to nabi to end up with potato boy.<br>Park jae on was emotionally manipulative, toxic and abusive. His characters has no proper character development. One of the worst kiss scenes are like wiping lips and kissing right after he kissed so someone in front of you. <br>Woo do hwan character from tempted even if he was a jerk from the start, we saw him redeeming himself for 5 years,we saw him feeling guilty, regretting his actions. His character was bad in the beginning,he has earned the forgiveness. I can&#39;t say the same for park jae on, 1 minute montage of looking sad under the tunnel that&#39;s it. Potato boy is character deserves so much better. Nevertheless one of the worst drama of the year. The drama deserves low percentage rating.
