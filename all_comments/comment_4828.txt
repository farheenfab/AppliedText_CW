Y’all really mad that the writer chose to go for a mature, non toxic, healthy relationship?? And suddenly Hyeyoung is boring lmao?? Just bc he isn’t conventionally hot, rich and broken? Ok. FYI her romance was a build up for Hyeyoung not a one hit wonder in highschool after a kiss. <br>Also Hyeyoung was never forward and aggressive with her. Mind u Sunho kissed her TWICE knowing she had a bf. The second time she did NOT like it and all she thought of was Hyeyoung at the moment. <br><br>Hyeyoung was the most selfless and patient man. And way more grounded. Sunjo shippers can disagree but don’t bash him.
