This Jojo girl is playin with people’s emotions..Hye-Young has been liked her but had to keep his emotions under control because of Sun-Oh. And Sun-Oh has the nerve to call Hye-Young a bastard in season 1 after what he has done for him?? Ridiculous😐.. Sun-Oh and Jojo have history together, and Sun-Oh still needs an explanation from Jojo cause this is an unnecessary mess. But at the same time- If they are going to give Hye- Young a chance we better get a 3rd or 4th season cus..😐👋
