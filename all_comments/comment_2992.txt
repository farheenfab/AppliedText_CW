I&#39;m so disappointed with what the writer did to jojo&#39;s character. He/she made her so selfish. Sun oh just wants an explanation for their break up but she couldn&#39;t even gave him that. I think it would be better if she didn&#39;t end up with anyone. An ending where the 3 of them move on from the past and grow individually might be a better ending
