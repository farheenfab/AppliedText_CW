Knowing that Hye Young is good, but it is common sense that Jojo should come to Son Oh. Because Son Oh was the first vibration, Jojo also because of fear and insecurity to break up with Son Oh, not love, if so, the ending should let Jojo realize and have the courage to walk towards Son Oh, excuse me Why does Jojo have another vibe with Hye Young and hesitates between the two? The ending made me really sad and disappointed: ((((
