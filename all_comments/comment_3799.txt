Just got the season 2 ep 4 and now Iâ€™ve found out who she chooses I donâ€™t really want to watch anymore lol I loved both characters but thereâ€™s just something about sun-oh character that outshined hye-yeong in my opinion. For one the actor who plays sun-oh is literally incredible! I might even go as far as saying heâ€™s my favourite male lead Iâ€™ve ever watched in any kdrama. Maybe Iâ€™m a bit biased bc I just canâ€™t resist a boarderline control freak whoâ€™s also an emotional wreck but also the actor just pulled it off so well. I could turn sub titles off and probably tell a whole lot just by his facial expressions. I also feel like jo jo and sun-oh had so much more chemistry! Like the first scene where theyâ€™re on the stairs you could just feel the tension which really creeped me out to be fair bc they were in god damn school uniform, I even had to Google their real life ages just to make myself feel betterðŸ˜‚
