Every drama, even if it&#39;s a character like Hye-yeong. Her love is very pure and natural. I was very impressed with this season as he is honest with the person he loves. In the beginning I already knew he was going to be with Jojo. Jojo didn&#39;t deserve Sunoh anyway. They both found their true love🧚‍♀️
