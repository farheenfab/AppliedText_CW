i think jojo keep avoiding sun-oh bcs she think that avoiding him will help her to get rid her feelings for him. She wants to have feelings for hye-yeong since he&#39;s always there for her when she&#39;s heartbroken and i think she just wants to pay him back by liking him but whatever she tries to do, she still like sun-oh at the end.<br><br>I actually want her to end up with sun-oh bcs that&#39;s what her heart wants to.
