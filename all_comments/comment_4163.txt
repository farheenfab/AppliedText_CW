Just bcoz you love Song Kang, you will all ignore the characters in the story. And there&#39;s a different chemistry between Jojo x Hyeyeong, you just fail to see it bcoz of your expectation to Jojo x Sunoh that got lots of scenes together in S1. The chemistry with Sun Oh is like a giddy high school first love type which is more intense, exciting and passionate, while the chemistry with Hyeyeong is like a warm newlywed love type that is patient, gentle, might be boring yet mature and heartwarming.<br><br>Most viewers and fans of LA are just really young to understand it and I guess that &quot;most&quot; Hyeyeong shippers are guys and are adults (just an assumption based on the comments in Facebook).
