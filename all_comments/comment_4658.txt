am i the only one who loved the season 2? i get why everyone dislikes it , but the plot twist wasnt forced upon , it was actually quite natural. towards the ending of the season , she asks a question to herself , whether she would have rang hye yeong’s love alarm if not for the shield. i would say if she had never gotten the shield , there wld have been a better chance she could have ended up w sun oh. and i wld have to disagree with u guys saying jojo and hye yeong has no chemistry whatsoever. in fact , they suit better with each other if u had given the chance to see it properly. it was a very simple , meaningful and real love. i wouldnt have minded if she ended up with sun oh but realistically it has been 5 years since they were last tgt , they were teenagers and naturally first loves don’t really last long. therefore the plot was quite realistic. people can move on and love other people , u cant change that.
