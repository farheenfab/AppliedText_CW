Itâ€™s undeniable Sun Oh and Jojo looks so much better as a couple. Everytime there are scenes with Hye Yong and Jojo together in S2, I would just fast forward coz the feel is just so different. Grew to like Yuk-jo and found Jojo more detestable as the story progressed. Sun Oh just deserves someone better.
