First k drama that i watched. Waited so long for season 2 and it ended up ruining the show. Sun oh got a shit ending when he was nothing but a good guy and good friend. Even gulmi had a happy ending and she was basically a villain. If I was sun oh I would kick duk guâ€™s Ass tho lol. Homeboy fucked sun oh over twice and then basically bragged about it to his brother
