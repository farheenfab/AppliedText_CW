The show is great. It&#39;s sad that all the butthurt fans downvote it, just because she didn&#39;t get together with sun oh. Of course she didn&#39;t, since he made her feel uncomfortable all the time. It&#39;s sad that so many fans prefer an unrealistic happy ending and not the realistic one that we&#39;ve been given. Love Alarm is like the series black mirror, it shows us the bad things about society and social media but also that true and unconditional love exists, we just need to find it. So yeah, jojo made the right decisions for herself, she chose not the most beautiful guy but the one who loved her the most. Great love story, great visuals, great drama.
