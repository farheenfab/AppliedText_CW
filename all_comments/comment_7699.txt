I haven&#39;t watched this drama ... Not even a single ep... But I have seen .. full drama explanation... ❤️ And honestly... I badly want Jojo to end up with sunho... It&#39;s the right choice for her... Since they r still in love with each other...😭😭😭 And I&#39;m gonna watch season 2 ... Only for sunho... To watch.. Jojo ending up with sunho... And I hope they will.... Like if they are not going to end up together... Than I would be left mad... That will badly hurt me... It&#39;s not right ... With hye yeong...i know... but at the end.. someone&#39;s heart is going to break... which we all know...😭💔 In  every kdrama... Where the audience want the sec lead to be the main hero and the person with whom... The female lead end...  But it&#39;s not happening... Even though if he deserve it... More than the main lead... And now where we want the female lead to end up with the main lead hero... May be it&#39;s not  going to happen... Which is very wrong...😭😭😭 <br><br>I wanted to request the maker... Plz let Jojo end up with sunho.... 😇😇😭😭😭
