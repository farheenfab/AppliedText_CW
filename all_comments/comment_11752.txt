Leaving everything.. can we just appreciate Song Kang&#39;s  acting <br>Whatever he is feeling you can just see right through his eyes <br>Sun oh is an sensitive and emotional character who has a lot of mental trauma <br>He seems so quite yet unstable <br>The sorrow that he has been holding since years just shows..<br>I love Song Kang&#39;s acting here and the character sun oh so much<br>He deserves the world 🌍❤️
