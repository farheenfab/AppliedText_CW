sun-oh deserves better!, tbh if Jojo didn’t put the shield in her love alarm then she can still be able to ring sun-oh’s alarm, and they would still be together because I know Jojo still loves sun-oh and ik she regrets breaking up with him but because of that GODAMN shield just literally broke my heart, I’m not blaming guk-du either I just really wish he never gave Jojo that shield, it’s very helpful for the people who wants to hide their feelings and not let that person know how they felt but it’s just not helpful for Jojo, it just made sun-oh’s life miserable! And ik season 2 has been delayed and will be push back to early 2021 and iv’e seen a sneak peak of some photos that they took during the shooting and I mostly see hye-Hyong and Jojo together in the photos, and it even made it more bad, I mean I’m a grateful person but it’s just not it! I need sun-oh and Jojo together! No more jokes Netflix this is literally my warning, or else your money will disappear like a wind
