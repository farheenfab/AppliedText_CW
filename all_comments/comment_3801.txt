I have no idea why people are so upset that Jojo ended up with Hyeyeong. From the get go I didn&#39;t like Son-oh. Yes he&#39;s a beautiful rich guy but bro. He literally sexually assaulted jojo. She gave him no consent at all to kiss her and Idk his character was just super weird. Like yeah they ended up dating and everything, but just his way of getting her, and KNOWING that hye yeoung liked her first. that was just dirty to me. Son-oh pressured her and everyting, he didn&#39;t respect any of her boundaries. But Hye-yeoung was literally the most kind hearted, patient, secure, loving man ever. He was willing to wait. Notice how they didn&#39;t even kiss until the very end. WE LOVE HYE-YEOUNG!!!!!!!
