I liked the ending y&#39;all actually need to grow up and understand what actually the meaning of love is and it can&#39;t be defined by an app. ðŸ˜ƒ hye yeong didn&#39;t gave a fcuk about whether Jojo ring her alarm or not meanwhile sun oh literally said to ring his alarm again in the first season itself. He kissed her when she had a bf, knowing his bff liked her. Then did the same mistake again playing with three hearts this time including his own gf. I don&#39;t understand how y&#39;all still support this kind of toxicity just coz he&#39;s handsome ðŸ˜ƒâœ¨
