As someone who has always seen Hye-yeong as a second lead even though he is not....<br><br><br><br><br>This scene is <b>IMMENSELY SATISFYING</b> its just like Sun-oh said... <b>The eyes don&#39;t lie</b><br><br>No hate on Sun-ho shippers but for me personally this was waayyyyy more heart fluttering than any of their scenes. The ONLY scene from Sun-oh and Jojo that comes close to to what i felt here was the scene where Jojo shouts <b>I LIKE YOU</b> back to Sun-oh in S1, That was a genuine loving scene that i can look back on with fondness.<br><br>But man, this bridge scene along with their FIRST bridge scene are my favorite moments through the series.<br><br>the music and the Special effects of the spear shooting through their barriers IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL it work so well together with the scene. This is scene is so perfect.
