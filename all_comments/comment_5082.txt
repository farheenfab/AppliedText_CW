Just finished ep 5 and i am so frustrated and disappointed with this season and jojo that i had to vent it out somewhere. I wont be watching the remaining epidodes cuz jojo makes my blood boil. SHE FRIGGIN WAVERS MORE THAN A WAVE!! LIKE GURLLL COMEON!!!! <br><br>In an interview, they said this season would show mature main characters but where the hell is character development??? The only &quot;matureness&quot; they&#39;ve shown in this season is that they&#39;re out of school and adulting. SOOOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTINGGGG!!!!
