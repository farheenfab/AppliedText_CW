Should I watch it ? Because I’m so disappointed in season one and now the trailer of season two still complicated . I don’t understand that why she hide herself from the guy who try to stay and always done everything for her. And other side , why the other guy would end up with her . While sun oh still love and think about her. I will wait till it release in full episodes and I watch for the end of end episodes to know that who does jojo choose ? If jojo doesn’t choose sun oh , I won’t watch but I will ask for answer and reason why ?
