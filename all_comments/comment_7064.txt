These are just some opinions on why theres a chance Sun-Oh and Jojo just might be the endgame :)<br>1. People think Jojo broke up with Sun-Oh because she didn’t love him, but the truth is that she broke up with him because she felt smaller the more she liked him, and after the motorcycle accident, she didn’t want to bring him any more trouble which is why she installed the shield. This could mean that she still loves him after all those years.<br>2. Remember the part when Sun-Oh and Jojo met in the allyway where they first kissed? Before Sun-Oh tried to kiss Jojo he said &quot;A kiss could bring back all those emotions&quot; but Jojo refused to kiss Sun-Oh back. In the trailer, he did kiss Jojo so after that kiss, Sun-Oh could have brought back Jojo’s feeling for him.<br>3. If you haven’t heard the 2nd song that played in the trailer, you can go and search it up. What I’m saying is the song sounds like something about Jojo’s and Sun-oh’s relationship.<br>That’s all :) (it’s just my opinion)<br><br>Edit: OH SH- THEY DON’T END TOGETHER I’M BRINGING YOU ALL WITH ME TO KOREA AND DIRECTING SEASON 3 OFF WE GOOOO
