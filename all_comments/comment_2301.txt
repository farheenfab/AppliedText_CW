Now that Iâ€™ve basically ruined season 2 for myself (I couldnâ€™t stop myself), can someone pls at least tell me, does Sun Oh get a happy ending because if he doesnâ€™t Iâ€™m not going to bother watching s2. Itâ€™s just going to break my heart even more ðŸ˜­ Sun Oh deserves better and Jojo doesnâ€™t deserve him.
