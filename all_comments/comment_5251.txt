I watched it. To be honest I did not expect this drama to suddenly take a turn ðŸ˜‚. I know Hye-young deserves jojo&#39;s love but I feel that Sun-oh and jojo still love each other. I was hoping for them to be together. I ship them. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sunohandjojo">#Sunohandjojo</a> .It&#39;s just my opinion. I personally did not like the girl character because it was wrong of her to break Sun-oh&#39;s heart for her own sake even though she knew that sun-oh loved her and he did nothing wrong. She even lied to him about the shield and also did not tell him the reason of her doing it  when he asked her so many times. I wished the second season to be different from what it is. I appreciate them trying something new and present an unexpected ending in a k-drama. But I think it did not turn out  that well. Now I gotta go to listen to why why why by Ikon.
