The ending was realistic. Hye-yeong never forced JoJo to like her back, he waited until JoJo was ready to free herself from all the pain she has and he waited for her after all those years. Wherein with Sun-oh and JoJo I always felt like they were too forced, it was rushed even at the beginning. It never felt like they were given the time to really have a deeper connection. I know people are upset. Who wouldn&#39;t want their bias(Sun-oh) to end up with JoJo, right? <br><br>We can all be mad and upset. But let&#39;s face it. Hye-yeong was the right person for JoJo. He sacrificed his feeling for her, and waited even after all those years. He kept his feelings for her and never forced her to love him back. He valued her so much that he was willing to wait when she&#39;s ready. The kind of love that deserves to be loved in return.
