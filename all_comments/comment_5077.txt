I just watched it and I’m PISSED. I absolutely hated the ending, I understand the lessons they were trying to portray in this season and the final outcome but I am not happy with it. Kim Jojo should have ended with Sun-oh, what was the point of their grand connection and all the tension between them if she chose the other guy. In the end, Sun-oh is the victim, and Kim Jojo’s character just comes off as selfish for installing the shield in the first place. She ruined him.
