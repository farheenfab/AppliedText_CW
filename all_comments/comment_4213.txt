When people are saying that Hyeyeong and Jojo&#39;s love to each other is just FORCED, inorganic, and no chemistry at all...<br><br>Come on ppl, how can &quot;building things up slowly&quot; and &quot;not forcing to be loved back&quot; be forced? So falling in love after the kiss of two people who barely know each other a natural love? Come on. And common chemistry is seen bcoz what y&#39;all see is romance and visual, but y&#39;all never see the passion, gentleness, and maturity at all.
