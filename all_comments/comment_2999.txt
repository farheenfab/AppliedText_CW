Unpopular opinion here, but Sunoh&#39;s character needs to grow up and I&#39;m grateful jojo didn&#39;t end up with him. And yes, I was rooting for him starting this season, but my opinion changed drastically. He is so stuck in the past and needs to let jojo go. It&#39;s been <i>years</i> and yet he&#39;s still holding onto a love that was from when they were mere adolescents. Everyone else has moved on, and he needs to too. Jojo has grown and is in a relationship. They&#39;re different people. Sunoh is so caught up with who jojo was and what they had that he fails to see that life isn&#39;t the same.<br>He needs to take a hint. Jojo has told him so many times that her choice is hyeyong and yet he still continues to pursue her like a child that can&#39;t get what he wants. Even when he <b>spoiler</b><br><br>ran after jojo in that classroom, hyeyong pointed out that the only thing he could focus on was what <i>he</i> wanted, not at all about how it would affect jojo. It shows that he&#39;s too focused on what he wants instead of her. <br>If he truly loved her, he would have respected her, her choice, and her relationship instead of continuously pursuing her and making her uncomfortable despite her requests not to.
