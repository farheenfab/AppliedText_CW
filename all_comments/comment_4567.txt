I don&#39;t know why are you guys so mad, I&#39;m in love with an ending, besides even in the webtoon she was with Hye Yeon in the end. He deserved her more, he was waiting for her, he never pressured her. This is the rare case when the second lead wins, and that&#39;s amazing because from the beginning all he did was care for her, and never forget how Sun Oh went after JoJo even knowing that his best friend liked her.<br>Also, I really enjoyed the way this season was shot, many details were added, great scenes and nature, so many details, and a lot of aesthetic scenes.<br>So, great season and the ending! <br><br>In the end, you should be with someone who really loves you in the most unconditional way, who will always be there for you in the most tactful and considerate way, and that is how HyeYeon loved JoJo.
