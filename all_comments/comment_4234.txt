I&#39;ve waited a long time for season two, now I&#39;m disappointed with the whole story. i think it doesn&#39;t reconnect well to the first season. sunoh didn&#39;t deserve this, I missed a whole day watching the episodes in the hope that jojo understood her true feelings for sunoh but it wasn&#39;t possible. i&#39;m really disappointed with this drama but that i loved the first season.
