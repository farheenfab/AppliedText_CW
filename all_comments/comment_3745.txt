For those people who say that SunOh and Jojo shippers are bad:<br><br><br><br>ACTUALLY,it&#39;s half of Hye-yeong fault, because Sun Oh asked him MANY times to tell him if he likes Jojo or not,and Hye-yeong just denieded it and told him to go after her...That were Hye-yeong words,so Sun Oh was in the right the whole time. Sincerely talking,i don&#39;t hate Jojo,but she was able to destroy a beautiful friendship,leaving Sun Oh alone to suffer, without even the only friend he has. How would you feel if it was you? Wouldn&#39;t you be desperate if that was your first love?  You guys can just thing about &quot;We get it that Sun Oh is the rich,popular guy and that doesn&#39;t mean that Jojo needed to end with him&quot; and tht&#39;s true,but for me it&#39;s better like this,Sun Oh is too good for Jojo,she doesn&#39;t deserve someone like him and the first thing in a relationship is TRUST and Jojo was lying till the end,so she deserved to end alone,BUT,i&#39;m happy with the ending(even if it was painful to reach to).<br>Remember,love can change you,and sometimes even make you act crazy (SunOh was claerly desperate and acted in that way).
