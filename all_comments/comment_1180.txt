I never ever comment on YouTube BUT I&#39;m commenting today because this is by far the BEST EVER kissing scene ive seen in my life. It was enough but not too much. I literally got butterflies watching it. The way he was so assertive and she was all shy and it just happened so organically.  The mood, environment and pace of the scene was perfection. You can tell he wanted to kiss her and I could feel the emotion in the small but passionate kiss. If they dont end up together they ruined the entire drama. Like they HAVE to be together PLEASE!!!!!!Please!!! Lol
