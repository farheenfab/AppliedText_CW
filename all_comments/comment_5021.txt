Well I’ve got sentimental after watching season 2. It’s the most reflectively realistic and decent ending I find. Since season 1 I’ve been rooting for Hye-yeong because Hye-yeong is always there for Jojo in the dark, even after two years he never dated anyone for the sake of dating out of loneliness. He’s a very decent man, earns normal income, works like a commoner like most of us do. Jojo never like public attention, she’s a quiet lady full of internal conflicts and emotions, trying to discover her true identity. The whole season develops their characters very well, from high school to work life, when you put yourself in Jojo’s shoes, you would realise as you age you would prefer settling down with a steady man whom you could trust and rely on. No dramas. No offence but I would love to date someone like Sun-oh oppa but Hye-yeong is someone you would like to marry and live with. Each of their characters is well-plotted, just that I secretly wish Gul-mi should have treated Duk-gu well towards the ending there but well in reality, Gul-mi’s reaction when realising Duk-gu is the founding developer is probably what most of us would have given. Hence why the drama is very relatable and realistic.
