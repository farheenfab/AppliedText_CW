This was a realistic drama and a meaningful story with a perfect ending.  She (JoJo)  deserves to be with a sensible and mature character and not a toxic guy whose behavior was excused just because he was hurt. In life everybody gets hurt, that&#39;s no reason to be horrible SO was a horrible character and to make excuses for him is wrong.  People who side with an unnecessarily dominant and indecent character just cause he&#39;s good looking need to grow up. Also breakups are usually messy and we don&#39;t always get the answers we expect. The mark of an adult is someone who learns to move and accept what you cannot change. She fell in love with HY who is her soulmate and he was her choice so just deal with and move on......
