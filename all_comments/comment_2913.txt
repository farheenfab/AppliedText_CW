Honestly love how the drama visually showed us JoJo choosing Hye Yeong. The symbolism of her having the strength to let her guard down and let that beautiful man know she loves him via A SPEAR SHATTERING THROUGH both her&#39;s and his barrier? <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b> Screw what the haters say THAT WAS POETIC CINEMA.
