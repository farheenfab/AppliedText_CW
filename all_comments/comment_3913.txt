After i watch this trailer, actually it&#39;s obvious that jojo will end up with hye yeong. But i gotta say that there are no correlation between season 1 and 2, i watched both season and honestly other than the character, nothing really connect this both season. It&#39;s like they rewrite a whole ass drama itself.
