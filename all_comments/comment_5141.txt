Netflix is so unfair i mean you can tell by the screen chemistry between sun-oh and jojo are really matched together even without the help of love alarm , but really i felt disappointed how they turn the table and she ended up with hyeong? I dont really feel excited about them i swear they wasted a nice story and watching them together is very cringy i am not against on them its just they dont have sparks at all and I rooted for sun-oh and jojo (other than the love story of the 3 main characters) the other extra story are boring and no sense at all. Season 1 is more better so please netflix dont bother to make it to season 3 if it is the same with this season 2 ðŸ¤¨ wth. My 2years of waiting just dissolve in 2 hours of disappointment. And each episode of this season such a depressing at all. Mostly all the characters are staring blankly and let us understand all. Theres no script or whatever !!
