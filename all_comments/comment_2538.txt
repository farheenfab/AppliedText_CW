Whatever but she really broke Su ho&#39;s heart.. i can&#39;t forget his teary eyes when he was waiting for her aside road with red scarf.. she literally is the reason for Su ho&#39;s broken heart.. who won&#39;t go crazy when someone they love changes in a couple of days ?? Y did she had to break his heart and not even once hug him.. fight with him.. for not being reachable after their bike accident ?? This girl is injurious.. i literally blame her for all this mess up..  hee jeyong is undoubtedly a sweetheart .. but y did she had to break Su ho&#39;s heart ?? U were angry when installed Shield .. i understand but did tht anger continued this long ?? Seeing Su ho breaking each day ?? She didn&#39;t melt ? Or she never loved him ? She is ridiculous ( the drama character) no matter what anybody says and whatever she does for hee jeyong !!
