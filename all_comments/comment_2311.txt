When he asked if she is doing well and Jojo just left really hurt me... like couldn’t she have just responded to him. Give him a little respect after you left him without even giving him a reason which messed up 4 years of his life. Not saying that Hye-Yeong doesn’t deserve Jojo, he waited for her for so long and he is a good guy but he deserves someone who won’t put him in a love triangle with his own childhood best friend. Hye-Yeong promised to protect Sun-oh remember? He let it all go because of Jojo. I love and hate this drama all at the same time. Like at times, I understand why Jojo is acting like this. But sometimes I just wish she responds to the person that’s talking to her rather than walking away. Jojo really makes me mad sometimes. And that’s how I know, So-hyeon did a great job acting out this character. All their acting skills are amazing and they definitely deserves credit for it. I just hope that there will be a season three and where the Sun-oh ends up with Jojo because I feel like Sun-oh deserves a happy ending after everything that he has been through during high school and his childhood
