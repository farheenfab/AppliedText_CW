Gurl hurry up and choose so the viewers can have the one you left behind!  üçø ü•¥<br><br>but in all seriousness, I hope the second season is at least decent enough to make me continue watching. <br><br>I did enjoy the first season even how it ended. I am also one of the few who fell in love with  Hye-yeong character that I am just rooting for his happiness no matter where he finds it....but boy do I hope he doesn&#39;t just end up waiting for her endlessly for nothing or not finding a person that can reciprocate his feelings. I also really hope they don&#39;t do his character dirty.
