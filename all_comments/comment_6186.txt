I have always liked the one who loved the girl first. It suppost to be Hye, right? But I don&#39;t like him. Don&#39;t get me wrong - I think he&#39;s friendly and funny, but I just... can&#39;t make myself to like him. He wasn&#39;t even brave enough to tell his feelings towards Jojo. He wasn&#39;t even brave enough to say &quot;Yes, I like her&quot; to his best friend. <br>But I really do love Sun-oh. From the very beginning. And I was so happy to see all his moments with Jojo. He was a wonderful boyfriend for her, he cheerish her so so much. That accident and all things that happend later... it&#39;s painfull. It really is painfull for me, a woman who have 27 years old. It&#39;s silly... <br>I really need and want Jojo and Sun-oh to be the end game. Who&#39;s with me? Somebody?
