Saw that some ppl say &quot;You did the same since School 2015... choosing the wrong guy&quot;<br><br>Me be like: Hyeyeong is much more like Taekwang personality aside. They&#39;ve always been with the lead girl&#39;s side even though they know that the girl doesn&#39;t love them. They never threw tantrums nor acted like a jerk when something between them did not go smoothly.
