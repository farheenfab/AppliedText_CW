I started loving Hye- young from the end of season 1 and thought that he deserved Jojo. He never asked anything from Jojo in return. That was the most generous and humble part of him. Hye-young truly deserves Jojo and I am personally very satisfied with the ending. You guys pair Jojo and Sun-oh, only because in your eyes Sun-oh is more attractive and the attractive boys always takes the heroine. But thats what makes Love Alarm different from all. It has a unique plot and we should respect it. This song is beautiful and revolves around the happy times of Jojo and Sun-oh together, but time changes, feeling changes and people changes. Hye-young created a space between Jojo&#39;s heart without demanding anything. I think that is all Love alarm&#39;s about. It&#39;s how Hye-young expresses his love for Jojo without ringing her alarm and even without saying it. Love alarm teaches us that true love doesn&#39;t means to be announced and it surely cannot be felt by an app. Its an emotion which is between two hearts. Sun-oh and Jojo were truly admirable and perfect but that doesn&#39;t means they have to end up together. What about the love of Yook Jo towards Sun-oh? or wasn&#39;t it true? Please think about her feeling too, as she was not a rich bad girl. She had also loved Sun-oh truly and she is the one who deserves him.
