Why do I feel like this relationship was wrong for so many reasons? <br>They developed feelings for each other because of the urge and rush to kiss each other. She&#39;s a beautiful angel and he&#39;s the hot popular guy. So their feelings for each other was built on the grounds of physical attraction. It had no emotional depths (though that built up eventually but still)
