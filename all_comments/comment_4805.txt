All you have to understand about the mad fans is: this is not about actors! It&#39;s about characters! And we found season 2 boring, nonsense, without a plot, and ridiculous. It&#39;s not just about sun oh, it&#39;s about JoJo character selfish childish and without motivation even though she&#39;s supposed to be in love with hye? Why she seemed depressed then? <br>Even the writer/director couldn&#39;t show her happiness<br>I&#39;m so sorry but the season 2 was 0/10 for me
