Misconceptions about Hye Yeong and reasons why he deserves to end up with Jojo.<br>1. He&#39;s a stalker: This is wrong and technically false. HY never harmed Jojo in anyway. The definition of a stalker is to pursue someone with obsessive  and aggressive behavior to the point of harassment, what HY did is to look after Jojo from afar without being seen as a burden, a love from afar, like a guardian angel. If I see anyone say but he followed her , I&#39;m gonna lose it! <br>Sun Oh also followed Jojo but why can&#39;t we say he&#39;s a stalker then? Cause he&#39;s good looking? Cause he&#39;s a flower boy? Lmao, sunjo shippers, y&#39;all aren&#39;t ready for that conversation.<br><br>2. HY doesn&#39;t have chemistry with Jojo. HY wasn&#39;t given enough screentime in S1 so we can&#39;t use that as the basis of judging their relationship, he was given only 2 episodes and in those 2 episodes, he was helping Jojo heal emotionally which is very critical for the storyline in the series, he&#39;s not forcing Jojo to love him but giving her the room and space to move at her own pace without making her feel pitied for or seen as a burden.<br><br>3. HY didn&#39;t confess to Jojo when he liked her first. If you&#39;ve analyzed the drama well, the reason he didn&#39;t confess to Jojo was mainly cause of the fact that she had a bf at the time and being the gentleman he is, he respected her enough not to cross the line and stick to his one sided love not cause he was scared to confess to her and he eventually confessed indirectly by ringing her alarm but he didn&#39;t want to complicate things and decided to give up since she had already chosen Sun Oh, even in that moment, he thought of Sun Oh and Jojo. why did the writers make him so selfless? I meanðŸ¥º.<br><br>4. HY should have told Sun Oh he liked Jojo cause he was asked many times if he loved her. If you paid attention to the series, Sun Oh clearly knew HY liked Jojo after seeing him follow her and also, during one of their conversations, HY said she has a bf. Also, SO and HY agreed to ring Jojo&#39;s alarm at the same time but SO went behind his back and confessed to JJ first so when JJ rang So&#39;s alarm, HY had to give up cause he valued his friendship with SO enough and also respected JJs decision choosing SO. If you noticed, HY also asked SO if he liked JJ and he denied it to which HY said, &quot;Jojo would be the one to choose&quot;. <br><br>5. HY shouldn&#39;t have pursued Jojo after 4 years knowing she was SO&#39;s ex. Can y&#39;all hear yourselves? So it&#39;s okay to pursue a friend&#39;s crush but it&#39;s not okay for someone to pursue a friend&#39;s ex when that friend did similar to them in the past? HY asked SO  whether he liked Jojo after 4 yrs and he said no, HY is not to blame for putting himself first for once and fighting for his happiness, y&#39;all called him as coward in their high school days and he doesn&#39;t want to repeat the mistakes of the past again which wasn&#39;t his fault cause he&#39;s a gentleman who choose respect over ulterior motives. I honestly don&#39;t get what y&#39;all see in Sun OhðŸ¤£. <br><br>6. HY can&#39;t say he loves Jojo cause he doesn&#39;t know her. That is technically false, there&#39;s love which you love from afar without expecting to be loved in return but hoping somewhere along the line, the other person opens up to you and accepts your genuine feelings towards them. All the times he was watching Jojo from afar taught him to see her scars which she hides and he didn&#39;t try to magically fix it but gave her the room and space to be comfortable letting it all out, he saw the deepest parts of her without demanding for it and having someone like that is rare and hard to come by. Nothing proves Jojo won&#39;t be able to love HY, their story is just beginning. <br><br>Y&#39;all can keep on bringing up reasons to justify why HY and JJ shouldn&#39;t end up together but you can&#39;t deny the fact that, that is the better ship. If you stopped for a second to think about what the characters need than who looks good together, you&#39;ll be able to appreciate the true meaning behind the storyline of love alarm. <br>Ship Hye Yeong and Jojo for clear skin!.
