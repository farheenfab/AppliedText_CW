guys no matter what team you are in Hye Hyeong is still best boy he deserves so much BUT NO ONE NOTICES IT! he was the FIRST to like Jojo and the FIRST person who wants to confess to her AFTER SHE BREAKS UP WITH HER BOYFRIEND but Sunoh over here didn’t even KNOW JOJO and KISSED HER WHILE SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND- and if that isn’t jealousy and obsessiveness idk what is (sorry to say this but...I just don’t really like Sunoh) and the fact that after Sunoh and Jojo broke up, Sunoh dated another girl JUST TO GET OVER HIS “feelings” for Jojo like Sunoh didn’t even know who Jojo was all he knew was that HYE HYEONG LIKED HER like y’all telling me he doesn’t deserve to date Jojo? Hye Hyeong best boy &lt;33 <br><br>disclaimer: this is MY opinion so pls respect it and I don’t hate Song Kang (the actor who plays as Sunoh) I just don’t like Sunoh but in fact I REALLY REALLY like Song Kang and he’s one of my favorite actor :)
