I like Hyeyoung tho. His love is more pure and more sincere. He also respects Jojo&#39;s feelings because he doesn&#39;t force her to like him back â™¡ He doesn&#39;t even get mad even though Jojo&#39;s heart is set to another. Sorry for team Sun Oh, but for me, that&#39;s what true love for me is.<br><br>I cannot question&#39;s Sun Oh&#39;s feelings, but I think, what better about him than Hyeyoung is just the looks. Nonetheless, whoever Jojo would end up with, I would accept it. But really, I am team Hyeyoung. If this happen to me in real life, I would choose someone like Hyeyoung (as if that would happen lol ðŸ˜‚)
