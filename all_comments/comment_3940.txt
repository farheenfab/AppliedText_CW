I think I didn&#39;t catch up with what the director would like to message us. So Jojo is in love with Hye-sung while Sunho didn&#39;t do anything wrong but she felt she would make him hurt and broke up. What matter is whom she actually loved in this series however I hate that kind of confused people dealing with their feelings. Maybe I am a Sun-jo shipper.<br>The character of the actress plots was not good and the ending is not what I expected.
