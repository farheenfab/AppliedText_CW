mmh i&#39;d rather have hyeyeong with jojo! both of them are mature but sunho, even after the 4years jump, isn&#39;t. i mean the way he talks to hyeyeong when he finds out hyeyeong still loves her and is planning on seducing her/flirting with her is just unacceptable. the way he said that hyeyeong used him all these years while he never did like? where did hyeyeong used sunho? hyeyeong was always there for him, even after sunho kissed jojo whereas sunho knew hyeyeong loves her. and when did we see sunho be that kind of friend to hyeyeong? as said, the relationship between hyeyeong and jojo has been built differently, they&#39;re taking their time to know each other (when they&#39;re in the little caf√© and are asking about their name, for example), which is something that never really occurred with sunho, they started their relationship with a kinda weird kissed in an alley where sunho tried so hard to make her change her mind about one kiss, he was talking about her lips and she was not really at ease (that&#39;s how it felt). sunho is kinda selfish imo, him asking jojo to make hyeyeong&#39;s alarm ring (when they&#39;re in sunho&#39;s car) when he doesn&#39;t have a word to say about it, and it shows on jojo&#39;s expression that she&#39;s kinda annoyed. him asking hyeyeong to make jojo&#39;s alarm ring when they were still in high schooll, just because he wanted to know if hyeyeong loved jojo. him again, asking to follow jojo while both hyeyeong and sunho are in the car. i mean, he was so pushy and never considered hyeyeong&#39;s feelings. tbh, i think that if sunho never knew that his bestfriend had a crush on her, he would never have saw her and would never have fallen in love with her. he never thought twice about dating her and about hyeyeong&#39;s feelings. i mean, he&#39;s supposed to be hyeyeong&#39;s bestfriend, and he knows that he loves her even if hyeyeongs says he doesn&#39;t. help him out instead of breaking his heart, talk to jojo about hyeyeong, introduce him to her, let them talk and have a relationship (a friendly one), and after that if she doesn&#39;t love him and develops feelings towards sunho, then that&#39;s okay. but it didn&#39;t happen, they didn&#39;t really know each other. and that&#39;s when we saw hyeyeong was and is still is the mature one. and the considerate one. &#39;cause he&#39;s taking into account his best friend&#39;s feelings and jojo&#39;s feelings and decides to back off. <br><br>for those saying that &quot;yeah but jojo loved sunho when they were younger and never loved hyeyeong&quot;, RIGHT, but her and hyeyeong didn&#39;t really know each other back then, they were just coworkers and never really spoke to one another. they could have if sunho tried to help his best friend but instead, he decided to pursue the girl while knowing hyeyeong was in love with her. and now that he&#39;s trying to do something about it and confessed to her, sunho is like &quot;bRO, you know what she did to mE hOW dARE You&quot; whereas hyeyeong never said a thing to what sunho did 4 years before because yeah, sunho loved her too and hyeyeong knew he didn&#39;t have the right to say something about his feelings, as he said to one guy &quot;you love who you love&quot; (well, he didn&#39;t say it that way but you know what i&#39;m talking about). and now that he has the opportunity to say his feelings to jojo because sunho has a gf, sunho still thinks he has a word to say to hyeyeong and that, that&#39;s something i don&#39;t find cool not mature especially with the way he says it and how he is full of bitterness and reproaches towards hyeyeong.<br><br>anyway<br>all these lines<br>just to say that<br>hyeyeong would be better for jojo and jojo would be better for hyeyeong
