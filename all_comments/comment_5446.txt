Whenever sun oh comes on the screen, 😍 his acting is worth watching and emotional. <br><br>And I didn’t like the story overall Love alarm as in whole.Didn’t like the girl character at all but she seemed more like a real person who would make choices just like she did. But I wanted her to end up with sun oh. Super annoyed about that! The writer should have done something because their feelings were real and it just ended up as a dream. It’s a series make it interesting 🤨!<br><br>The people who are new to this drama, would recommended you to watch season 1 for sun oh and season 2 for hye Yeong. Don’t watch both😩. <br><br>Yuk jo is a cutie! <br><br>The whole series star is definitely Song Kang.
