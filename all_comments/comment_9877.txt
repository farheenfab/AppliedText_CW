My theory on what will happen *SPOILER*:<br><br>Love Alarm Version 2.0 will tell you that a certain person has the potential to like you back. In this case, Jojo can like/love Hyeyoung. I think this will be the same case for Sun Oh and his girlfriend. Jojo will eventually get rid of the shield. Jojo and Hyeyoung will date and get closer but she will not ring his alarm. For Hye young, he will not care if that is the case. Given the circumstance, Sun Oh will do his best to make Jojo his given that he knows she can’t ring Hye Young’s alarm. He will eventually kiss her in attempt to make her his. This would cause Jojo’s profile be deleted or removed in Hye Young’s list of potential people who will like him. <br><br>Jojo will confront Hye Young about the kiss and tells him that he is a fool and that he should be mad at her. But Hye Young will not give up on her and wait for her. <br><br>In the final moments, Jojo will meet the developer and ask him who does she love. I believe she will make a choice and that choice will be Hye Young. Both of them will meet in the bridge at sunset. It will be the moment of truth for Hye Young as either A. Jojo will ring his alarm or B. It does not ring because Jojo will not let an app choose who she loves. They hug and be with each other as they live in Hye Young’s apartment. <br><br>This is just a theory. I’m not the director or the writer but if I want to convey a message regarding Love Alarm. I want to tell everyone that in the end, it’s just an app in your phone. The one you love will be always be your choice. For me, Jojo needs Hye Young as he provides comfort to Jojo’s life of grief. Her parents killing themselves and life with her terrible aunt and cousin. She needs comfort and companionship from the world. <br><br>It’s true that Jojo and Sun Oh had chemistry but for me, their love in the first season was pure and innocent but at the same time it was immature as Jojo mentioned before. It does not matter who she ends up with but it will always be her choice. <br><br>The app is only a tool but you will have to follow what your heart desires and needs.
