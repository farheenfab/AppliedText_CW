Okay so most of these comments are really aggressive about Kim jojo and who she will get with, I understand why but at the same time this is what I think. <br><br>I came across a comment that said sun oh was â€˜fighting for Kim jojoâ€™ but in reality he got beat for kissing her after she said she has a boyfriend  (I believe she should have done more to get him to not kiss her so sheâ€™s also in the wrong)  and to see people support him after this is just very irritating, yâ€™know? <br><br>Also, Sun oh had kissed her knowing that Hye Yeong had liked her just to get a reaction out of him. <br><br>People gloss over the fact that Kim Jojo has experienced Trauma and yes after a while it doesnâ€™t serve as the main reason for the relationship of her and sun oh to end, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the trauma isnâ€™t going away and for my opinion for who she should end up with, I believe that her and Hye-yeong would be good together. He has sacrificed so much for the both of them during their high school years itâ€™s unbelievable, he saved sun oh from drugs that his mother put in his drink, he gets beat up for sun-oh knowing what he did was wrong but because heâ€™s a good friend of course he jumps in, he stays away from Kim jojo even though he still likes her because he didnâ€™t want to interfere with their relationship, and the fact that sun-oh said the hye-yeong was using him was completely over the line and was unfair for him because of what sun-oh did to him and all the stuff hye-yeong did for his relationship. I believed that if Hye-yeong had the love alarm app and so did Kim jojo that they would have been together in the beginning but of course that wasnâ€™t the case so sun-oh was the first to ring her love alarm once he started to develop feelings for her, I feel bad for sun-oh girlfriend because she lies for him and she still stays with him even though he doesnâ€™t ring her love alarm but she tries her hardest until he does. I would honestly cry for Hye-yeong if he doesnâ€™t end up with Kim jojo because he has already been heart broken by Kim jojo and sun-oh but still wanted them to be happy together and I will feel really sad for him if Kim jojo didnâ€™t pick him.<br><br>This is just my opinion on who she should get with and regardless of who she picks you shouldnâ€™t talk down/low on this K-drama because itâ€™s a good show to watch and we just want whatâ€™s best for the characters that we like I would put more of my opinion into this but itâ€™s already too long. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
