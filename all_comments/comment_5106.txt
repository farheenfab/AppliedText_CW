I&#39;m really happy with this ending. If you don&#39;t want to be spoiled stop reading. Hye-young was definitely the right person for jojo, personally I&#39;m so confused as to why people are so obsessed with Sun-oh (the character not actor). This ending was realistic, for Jojo Sun-oh was her first love, that is why she had &#39;strong feelings&#39; for him throughout the drama , people that are hating on Jojo are failing to realise that she was young and had traumatic past that stopped her from openly loving. Hye-young loved her from the beginning and his character is just so well made, his love for Jojo was real, he patiently waited for her, didn&#39;t force her but was there for her. Argh i cant explain it but it&#39;s so upsetting to see people so upset with the ending, because when you watch the whole drama how can you not root for hye-young!?
