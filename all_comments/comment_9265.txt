Obviously, Jojo will end up with HY. I am team sun-oh and its okay with me. <br><br>This was all jojo&#39;s fault. She left sun-oh without reason. She messed-up on her own.<br><br>Sun-oh deserves better, I will agree more if he end-up with YukJo. <br><br>And I do think, SongKang wasnt able to finished the filming because he has an on-going film (sweet home) same time they filmed the S2 of Love Alarm.<br><br>Anyway, Whatever happens in the end. I will accept, hoping they&#39;ll make SUN-OH happy at end.<br><br>Also, Will just watch because of SongKang. Haha üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
