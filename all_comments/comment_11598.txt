Me watching this still hoping that she will choose sun oh .and that last part really gives me hope that it  is still  sun oh til the end .I like hye Yeong too but you cannot blame us why we still want sun oh and jojo to be the endgame,you let us love them in season 1 so how can we just move on  that easily .I know we all need to consider their feelings toward each other but that 6 episodes in season 1 was still remain in our hearts .even we already knew what happened in webtoon we still hoping that the will end up together<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunoh">#teamsunOh</a>
