The trailer tbh is frustrating. She&#39;s trying to love Hye young... Why?? Is that a must? She left Sunho over nothing and now is trying to be with his friend, ruining all their friendship and relationships 🤦🏻‍♀️ idk if it was me, even if my ex&#39;s bff was the only man on earth, I wouldn&#39;t date him.<br>Anyways I just hope Sunho is happy because he&#39;s so clueless of why she left him, he was so hurt and suffered so much... He deserves to be happy the most
