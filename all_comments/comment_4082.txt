I m happy with the ending. In season 1 when hyeong loves Kim jojo but he sees his friend also starting loving her. His friend knows very well that hyeong loves Jojo but still he kissed her in second meeting and after that they fall in love with each other. Some how I feel hyeong&#39;s love was so pure. I know both the leads love her but for me hyeong was the best. Love is not only kissing but heong always wanted to keep her happy and he was okay with that if she doesn&#39;t love him or dump him. There are many instances where I found heong love beyond than him. He was ready to sacrifice his love for his friend. But when they broke up then he confessed his feelings for her. ❤❤❤
