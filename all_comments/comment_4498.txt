It was an ending no one expected and that&#39;s what I like about this drama<br>SO fresh and new- not the typical style we would expect<br>Life and love is not as perfect as we think- this is what&#39;s beautiful and special about this drama<br>I cried at the ending because I loved the realistic aspect of it!!<br>I wonder if they would ever create a third season how it would be<br>I doubt they would because of the closure they gave it but maybe have new cast and a diff story because I love the love alarm concept<br>Fighting!!! One of the best dramas- UNFORGETTABLE!
