I guess she will choose Sun-oh because her photo disappears from hyeyeong, that means she will not fall in love with him.. And i also think she tells hyeyeong that she still likes Sun-oh and maybe she tells him that she don&#39;t want to hurt hyeyeong and maybe hyeyeong agrees with her and let her go, so maybe she is telling hyeyeong that &quot;you fool, aren&#39;t you mad? &quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=63">1:03</a>
