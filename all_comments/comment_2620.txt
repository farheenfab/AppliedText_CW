The spear scene is iconic<br><br>The truth is LA was the brilliantly told story of JoJo&#39;s &amp; Hye-Yeong&#39;s love story. The story of how a generous and selfless man heals a emotionally damaged woman and wins her love. There never was a love triangle or need for teams Hye Yeong patiently waited for his opportunity to win her heart, and did when he showed her through patience and kindness what true love was. At no time after breaking up with Sun-oh did she consider taking him back. In fact it was Sun-oh behavior and relentless hounding of her that only cemented in her heart that she truly loved<br>Hye-Yeong.  There was never a choice to be made, only the beautiful story of how two people fell in love regardless of the LA app.
