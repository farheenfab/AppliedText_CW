Jojo was a Loser in this.  She played with two lives.  Sun Ho - depicts his love for her that was &quot;TRUE &amp; REAL&quot; and she tramples all over that.  The story shows no connection with Jojo ever understanding what Sun Ho was going through or being there for him when it counted, like he was to her.  SELFISH &amp; COLD HEARTED is what the character Jojo.  Loved  HYE-YOUNG as the STRONG, KIND &amp; UNDERSTANDING friend that was selfless.  He knew what SUN HO&#39;s life was like and did not envy it at all.  Whilst he deserved something great in his life, I do not feel the story connected well between Jojo turning away her love which she knew she has in her heart for SUN HO.  Hence the reason she had to use the SPEAR to show HYE-YOUNG that she had feelings.  I would rather they both turned away from her when they found out what she had done.  Then they could have met further down the track in years.  The story line is weak I think even though it shows how people rely upon an APP to show who they should be with or not.  Duk Gu was a great friend to Jojo.  Disappointed and would not recommend to my friends this show.
