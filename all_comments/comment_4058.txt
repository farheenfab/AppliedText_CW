Just came here to say I&#39;m GLAD Jojo made her first right decision and realized (not chose) the one she loves is Hye Yeong. <br><br>I know there are still Sun Oh fans who hated the ending, it&#39;s normal to fall in love with the handsome, famous, protective guy. But that was in highschool. Feelings can change. I also didn&#39;t understand why Jojo broke up with him, but it&#39;s her personal issues that I do not know. She needed time to grow and face her hidden fears. <br><br>I appreciate Hye Yeong in season 1 and more so in season 2. He&#39;s patient, loving, and caring. You wouldn&#39;t look for the famous, cool guy if there&#39;s someone like Hye Yeong waiting by your side. That&#39;s more realistic. He even gives you assurance by ringing your alarm 10x a day ðŸ˜‚<br><br>Duk Gu even told Jojo that she likes Hye Yeong, she just didn&#39;t hear her alarm rang by him first. In the end the love alarm was the flaw and caused possibilities to fade because people trusted the alarm too much.
