I know many people support Hye yeong but I&#39;m going for Sun Oh he has such a pure love for her and I think they were really genuine while they were together. In the other hand,  with Hye Yeong it seems as if  they are both trying too hard even though it is not fulfilling  for them because she cares for him but doesn&#39;t really love him and he can&#39;t seem to receive back all the love he gives her. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunoh">#TeamSunOh</a>
