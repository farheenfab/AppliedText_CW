So basically a guy (your best friend) knows you like a girl and starts having interest in her because you like her... Then kisses her.. Then starts dating her.. Then they break-up.. But you never stopped loving her so you go and chase her, but your Best Friend gets mad at you for NOT TAKING HIS FEELINGS IN CONSIDERATION.. And Jajajaja everyone supports Sun Oh despite the hipocrisy.. Very good that is such an irony.. Can&#39;t understand who would ever want a friend like Sun Oh.. But still he gets the supportðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ and everyone likes him more than the guy who ALWAYS LOVED HER.. Please, it&#39;s seriously non sense.. Support Hye Yeong
