I am currently on the 5th ep of season 2.And honestly iam team hye-young now. He liked her since the beginning. Sun oh IS a good match for jojo.But idk if they&#39;ll be happy together.She can&#39;t always get hooked on to a highschool relationship. Its good she moved on. But what she did to sun oh was really sh*ty tho
