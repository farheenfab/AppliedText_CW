For me, l really like S2 ep 1 and ep 6 (specially the last scene) but the rest of ep was really boring not exactly boring but it&#39;s doesn&#39;t really make excited me to watch it because it feels like something is missing there and I really hate how the way JoJo look at Sunoh it just piss me off. She made it look like Sunoh was the one who did wrong. It will be great if JoJo herself explain the reason she brokeup with him (which she didn&#39;t). I&#39;m really happy that hye get JoJo because his love towards her was really pure and cute. And I love how JoJo rings her own violence. Even as I&#39;m <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunoh">#teamsunoh</a>... I like the ending but not exactly happy with it. We <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunoh">#teamsunoh</a> were not happy with ending because JoJo herself really didn&#39;t explain the reason towards Sunoh which made us really mad, sad and angry. I&#39;m glad that Sunoh ended up with the girl that love him so much. Now after watching S2 for me JoJo really doesn&#39;t deserve Sunoh. She just left him alone and make him sad and lonely which he really doesn&#39;t deserve to be. I ended up hating JoJo character expect only at the ep 6 (last scene).<br>And many people are saying that Sunoh is selfies one but in reality every one is selfies ( main character) in drama. No one is loyal to eachother.  Love alarm is my favourite drama list but for me S2 is somehow missing something. So, it will be great if the story line was full clear in details...
