What a very BEAUTIFUL and REALISTIC STORY. JOJO found someone who truly loves her, cares for her and most especially someone who RESPECTS her. Jojo is a character who can easily be swayed bcoz she wants and needs LOVE. when SO tried to steal her from her bf Ilsik, she got swayed. When HY approached her, she gave him a chance. After then, Sun oh tried to win her back, but she was not swayed by Sun oh anymore. Know the reason why? bcoz she fell deeply inlove with Hyeyeong. The foundation of their relarionship was too great for her to be swayed again. And she learned how to know,choose and understand her feelings very well w/o the app. That&#39;s how Hyeyeong had affected her life. As she said, she has learned a lot from her relationship with Hyeyeong. Hyeyeong RESPECTED her and supported her all the way. Well, this drama is too deep. Many wud not understand. Overall, I love the depth of the story. Keep safe everyone!
