I had just watched first 10mins of season 2 ep1, nd after finding out that jojo didn&#39;t end up with sun-oh I&#39;m not interested anymore.I really like hye yeong bt still I admire jojo nd sun-oh as a couple . Jojo rejecting Sun-oh for some reasons nd leaving him depressed behind sounds so damn senseless....
