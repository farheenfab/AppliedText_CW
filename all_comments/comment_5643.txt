No this will be the worst ending if she doesn&#39;t ends up with sun oh. Like she ended it with him over something he didn&#39;t have anything to do with and then still kept loving her. And she loves him too. He don&#39;t deserve to lose her like that... If she ends up with Hye Yeong then this will be one of those dramas that had terrible ending. This trailer gives me the vibe that it&#39;ll end up just like the webtoon. Forcing to love someone else
