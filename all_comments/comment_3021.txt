Felt so bad for Sun Oh. Though he understood Jojo in the end, still, I was expecting for a proper and clear explanation coming from Jojo herself. She&#39;s so tongue-tied and I really hated her for that. I understand her trauma and she&#39;s emotional but what the heck is wrong of explaining things instead of hitting around the bush??<br><br>Though I&#39;m team Hyeyeong, I can&#39;t blame Sun Oh why he got stuck from the past and can&#39;t move forward... and that&#39;s bcoz there were many things that he&#39;s clueless about. How could he even move on and love Yuk Jo back if there were some questions running in his mind and there&#39;s no vivid explanation? Everything that he understood was just discovered by himself: (1) by realizing that Jojo really fell for Hyeyeong when Jojo said that she could only think of HY when SO went to her campus, (2) by finding out that her mom met Jojo bfore their breakup--which is still quite unclear for me, and (3) by just looking and reading The Ringing World&#39;s illustrations and their captions.<br><br>Though it&#39;s vague, stil crossing my fingers for a 3rd season---a season which would unfold the things that are not answered completely and ofc, for Sun Oh&#39;s arcs showing his growing relationship with Yuk Jo. This is what I hope for.
