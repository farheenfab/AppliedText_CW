I am very glad that the directors decided that she will end up with Hye-young. I may be in this less % of people here.. However, for me it would be completely irrational if she gives Sun-oh a chance after all this time. Time has passed, she changed, moved on and  slowly started to feel secure thanks to Hye-young, a loving and carring guy. He did not pushed Jojo in her emotions, he was just there for her. And then we have Sun-oh, a cry baby over everything. He did not move at all with his life, he is just sad all the time, his job is nothing for him, he uses the girl that is crazy over him. And demands Jojo to be with him without giving anything back. He is following her everywhere, stalking her and pushing her with his mixed emotions. He has no respect for Jojo till the last conversation in ep 6. (and for any other person, too). <br><br>I understand that Jojo may be confused about her emotions since once she may had feeling for Sun-oh. First love is something that we will remember forever. Yet, I believe that Sun-oh actions in season 2 only ensured her how much she changed and all any emotions should stay in the past.<br><br>Anyway I was pissed at 2 things. 1) the season was so boring and slow paced. I thought I would fall asleep. 2) Yuk-Jo.. I cant believe directors decided that she will welcome Sun-oh with open arms after all he had done to her.. She treated her like crap, I understand she loved him anyway but girl be strong! have some self respect! You can do better. Be strong!
