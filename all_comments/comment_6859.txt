lmfao this ended up being more serious that i wanted it to be, also there might be spoilers (maybe) since i read the webtoon the drama is based off of<br><br><br><br><br>see, this is why kdramas are so much better than some (most) western dramas. you have an emotional connection with the characters at some point in time by learning their past and faults. while i love the idea of sun-oh and jojo, and believe that if they end up, they deserve each other, i also love hye-yeong and jojo, which is what ended up happening in the webtoon. also, i can relate to jojo&#39;s conflicting emotions, since making any tough decision is more difficult than anyone could imagine. while both men deeply care for her, with or without the app, she also deeply cares about the both of them (she tries to deny her feelings for sun-oh and tries to love hye-yeong). anywho, im so happy the second season came out, and im waiting to watch on netflix.
