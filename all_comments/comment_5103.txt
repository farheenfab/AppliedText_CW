To everyone saying &quot;Jojo still likes Sun Oh&quot; even in Season 2...stop lying to yourselves. There&#39;s literally nothing in season 2 that indicates she still loves Sun Oh. She told Sun Oh herself OUTRIGHT that when she saw him again she was thinking of Hye Young. Dukgu said the moment she fell in love with HY is when she gets removed from his list of &#39;people that might love her&#39;. When did her name vanish from HY&#39;s list? WHEN SUNOH KISSED HER. Sun Oh kissing her literally made her realise she was in love with HY. <br>So yes, Sunjo shippers stop deluding yourselves, my girl wanted HY even after he broke up with her.
