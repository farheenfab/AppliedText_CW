please dont hate on hyeyeong. He literally like jojo without the love alarm app. Sun oh was the one decided to confess to jojo when he knows that hye yeong likes her. but did hye yeong try to steal jojo when they were dating? nope. hyeyeong came to jojo&#39;s life when jojo need someone to hold her. i dont hate on sun oh too. he did not deserved the hate. jojo was the one who broke up with him. the problem is jojo was not able to tell how she felt for them both. so yeah adulting is hard.
