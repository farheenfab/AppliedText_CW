JUST FINISHED binge watching season 2 and: <b>A LIL SPOILER</b> I&#39;m so disappointed in season 2, I wish I never watched, can&#39;t believe I waited 1 year and a half to see that. Don&#39;t get me wrong, HyeYoung is a gentleman and deserves all the happiness in the world but if they wanted to make her stay with him then don&#39;t make an entire Season 1 when the plot is how basically Sun Oh is the love of her life and she&#39;s lying and going all over the place to protect him, not to mention that they basically changed the lead actor from season 1 and 2, Sun Oh who was the male lead character had hardly any meaningful scene, it was all about him being petty and crying (where was his lines? he barely got any). It was such a good show, but i don&#39;t know what they tried to do with the second season, but boy let me tell IT DIDN&#39;T WORK, and i&#39;m not even talking just because I don&#39;t ship Jojo and HyeYoung, it was just all over the place. One thing that I can&#39;t hold it any longer is Park Gul Mi (the girl that lives with jojo), the entire first season was showing how she was so child, arrogant, just wanted money, no personality, basically a terrible person who treated everyone like trash, the literally FINISHED the season with her being like this, and they made season 2 portraying her character LITERALLY the same way! No character development whatsoever! I&#39;m sorry about the rant but DAMN was i pissed when I finished. Anyways, the actors are amazing i love them all, can&#39;t wait to their next projects, but this show was a waste of a really good cast and the show had a lot of fans, it could&#39;ve been a hit again.
