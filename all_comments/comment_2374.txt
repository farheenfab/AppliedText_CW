it would be so much better if they started where they finished in the first season or continuing with the fact that Jojo still feel something about Sun-oh. Because it doesn&#39;t make any sense when she treats him like that and then she said she get &quot;emotional&quot; when thinking about him in the last episode. Maybe it&#39;s just me but I don&#39;t understand Jojo&#39;s feelings because I feel like the drama was a little bit off sometimes when showing her feelings, it doesn&#39;t seemed like a second part, it&#39;s seems like a whole different series.
