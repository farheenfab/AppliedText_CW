I am not gonna lie I had very high expectations for this cause season 1 literally left me hanging but this doesn’t look good. I didn’t think we’d still be playing those games of who do I like for another whole season baby no there’s no way I am watching this mess. Also I already read the end and it’s not it, byeeee imma prétend season two never excited.
