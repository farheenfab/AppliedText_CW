just because you guys like them to be together doesn&#39;t mean that they will grant your wishes, I know Sun-oh and Jojo&#39;s relationship is cute, but Hye-yeong is more better, Sun-oh kissed Jojo who had a boyfriend and Hye-yeong&#39;s crush, just because the kiss was hot doesn&#39;t mean you will forgot the important detail, which is Jojo had a boyfriend on those days, while Hye-yeong was respecting her privacy because she had a boyfriend, he even let Sun-oh love Jojo, he waited for 4 years to Jojo just to court her even though Jojo doesn&#39;t love him in those days
