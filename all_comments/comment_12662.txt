You know what... at this point I just want KIM JOJO TO STAY SINGLE. Seriously, both of the guys are too good for her, like this dumbass playing with both of them as if they don&#39;t have hearts as well! Even if it turned into a BL drama, I would be happy rather than having to see one of the guys getting hurt because of this stupidass 🤦🏼‍♀️
