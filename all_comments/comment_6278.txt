Ugh fml this is why I hate love triangles. Jojo is over here playing both sides when itâ€™s obvious she should be with Sun-Oh and Hye-Youngâ€™s stupid ass isnâ€™t taking a hint and backing off for a minute. I feel like if she truly liked Hye-Young she wouldnâ€™t still be thinking about Sun-Oh. Sis needs to wisen up and pick Sun-Oh quick or we finna have a problem on everything cause Sun-Oh doesnâ€™t deserve this mistreatment. ðŸ˜¤âœ‹
