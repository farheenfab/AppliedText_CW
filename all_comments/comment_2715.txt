Tbh, I dislike all toxic sunoh and jojo shippers for their selective memories. Eventho its true that they look cute together, its evident that they are both broken by their family members so they will never heal each other. If Jojo stayed with Sunoh, she will never heal because she felt super underqualified and little when she&#39;s with sunoh. She love him but she didn&#39;t love herself while loving him. Unlike Hyeyeong who taught her to love herself while loving him. Jojo and hyeyeong have the best love story and its sad how their romance was set aside because sunoh and jojo dated for like a month in highschool and they look good together. ðŸ˜‚ Its true Jojo need to apologize to Sunoh so he can finally move on, but if you hated Jojo y&#39;all better hate Gulmi and her mother because all of Jojo&#39;s insecurities and miserable life was cause by them!! Its painful how y&#39;all forget how miserable jojo&#39;s life was until she met hyeyeong. He is the best partner for jojo! PERIODT.
