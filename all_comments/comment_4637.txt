I&#39;ve watched this show blindly and I&#39;m not one to watch kdramas, but I enjoyed it as it is and I&#39;m happy with the ending. It was mature, healthy, and realistic. Hye yeong is so precious - to be able to stay patient, supportive, and attentive despite Jojo&#39;s indecisiveness. A true example of a secure guy, but of course anxious when it comes to a new relationship. It really feels like he&#39;s real.<br><br>I get why people like Sun Oh since he is the popular rich guy and has a love that is young and innocent like in most typical romance shows but he was too emotional for me. Plus, I&#39;m not a fan of how he approached Jojo in the show knowing that his best friend likes her. From there, I had a bad impression of him, which is why I like Hye yeong more (giving Sun Oh his chance at love without intervening. I think that&#39;s where people fail to see). His actor was great though. At some point I felt pity for him to unable to recover his breakup during the past 3-4 years. I felt so relieved that he had closure with Jojo so he can move on and start fresh in his career and like Yuk jo properly. The story breaks common relationships in films by making the second male lead get the main girl. It was refreshing to see that.
