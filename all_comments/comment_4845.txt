I swear i just finished it 5 / 10 minutes ago.. and in am really dissapointed.. i really waited until the end that there was still enough ˋscenesˋ that would lead for a hopeful 3rd season with sunho.. i like hyeyoung and i really like the actor too. But the chemistry was nowhere. I was already at 4th episode where i thought : ´did anything happen until now?  isnt anything interesting going to happen?´ the writer / diroctor really did a poor job. I waited so long for this..
