I know alot of people like Hyeyoung because he&#39;s a sweetheart and he likes JoJo for the longest time and he also recognises boundaries(thus why he&#39;s just there and not taking actions which can be both a good and bad thing). But honestly, this is one of the many scenes where I think Sun-oh is good for her because he&#39;s been there for her during her toughest times. He&#39;s proactive when it comes to their relationship and i like that. I felt like the reason why Sun-oh and JoJo instantly connected despite their differences is because at that time they were each battling their own personal issues and they somehow relate to each other because of that. I guess you could say they became each other&#39;s supportive anchor? JoJo wanted something stable in her life and someone who could understand her circumstances and just be there for her. Just a small hopeful light against the darkness of her life and Sun-oh provided that for her. She didn&#39;t have to &#39;pretend&#39; for him. She can just be herself, scars and all. Sun-oh wanted attention that is reciprocated from the people he care about. He couldn&#39;t get that from his parents which was why he turned to Hyeyoung for that. But he felt as if Hyeyoung felt obliged to tend to him due to their dynamics as the boss&#39; son and the maid&#39;s son. He can&#39;t help but to ponder and question about the genuineness of the attention he&#39;s getting. And here comes Jojo, who is an outsider and has no relation to him, who happens to give him that genuine attention he craves. People do give him attention. But they are all for superficial reasons like for his looks or the fact that he&#39;s the son of famous well-known parents. JoJo, on the other hand, is different. She gives him the attention that he craves and deserves. Its not attention for his looks nor is it attention for his social status. It is simply for him as a person. That being said, these two have a strong history together. Their attraction for each other is not just on the surface. Its because one provides something which the other needs. They are each other&#39;s comfort. I think the potential pairing of JoJo and Hyeyoung would be very sweet and it definitely has potential but i would also think that it would be quite easy. Not saying that relationships like that are not valid because there are plenty of easy-going relationships that are just as strong out there but JoJo and Sun-oh literally went through alot during their relationship. Sun-oh was there with JoJo during her worst times. Sun-oh gave JoJo her smile and JoJo gave Sun-oh his but eventually stole it away from him and left without giving an explanation on why :(
