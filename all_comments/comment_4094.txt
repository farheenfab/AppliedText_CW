Honestly, I think it was best if she didn&#39;t end up with Sun-oh.. he was really aggressive after they broke up and was making her mad.. for example: Going to her seat and embarrassing her in front of everybody in the class and making her confused and stuff. And plus, after the break up he was &quot;calling her out&quot; for breaking up with him. I&#39;m glad she got somebody who was honestly kind and generous.
