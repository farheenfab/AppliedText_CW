Loved this season, but not more than S1. It was quite unclear and complicated.<br>I didn&#39;t really care whom Jojo would end with. But I loved how the characters developed. I had be happy with who ever Jojo had ended up with as SunJo were the eachother&#39;s first loves. And for HyeJo, as Hyeyeong waited for her to reciprocate her feelings.<br>At last both the couples had happy endings.
