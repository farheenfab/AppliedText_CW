I think Suh Oh will be obsessed and depressed because jojo still lock her alarm for him. Make jojo love hye yeong and hye yeong will give up seing Sun Oh suffering and they will parted ways. Jojo is not sure about her feelings and sun oh doesn&#39;t do anything but they&#39;re hurting him. Hye yeong just want jojo but sun oh keep showing up so he&#39;s selfless also. They need to love there self first. Grow up. Confess all the lies and decided. But being friends is the most best decision for them. If jojo keep her lie the love alarm will never be end.
