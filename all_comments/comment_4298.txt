In this drama ; Firstly , Sunho asked hyeyong many times that whether he likes jojo or not . But Hyeyong always said that he doesn&#39;t like jojo. After hearing this from hyeyong , Sunho went for jojo. So there is no fault in sunho .<br>Also sunho waiting for jojo when she dumped him without any reasons   just for her own goodwill. This shows that jojo is such a selfish character. <br>Finally , second season was just a disaster. What was the use of first season if jojo was ending with hyeyong in the second season. <br>Also thanks to love alarm , it is the first time I&#39;m hating a female lead in a drama , kim jojo - such a dumb character who play with others feelings just looking for her own happiness. <br>For sunho fans,<br>Be happy as jojo left him  , jojo is such a dumb jeleous character. She doesn&#39;t deserve sunho.<br>I never liked jojo in the entire show. So I&#39;m somewhat happy that she doesn&#39;t choose sunho. If she chooses she would leave them for her personal happiness. <br>So be happy as she left him.
