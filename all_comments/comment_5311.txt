It&#39;s just unfair that even without watching the s2, people are spreading hate in the comment section. For me the ending was satisfying because Hye Young really deserved the girl. He gave his all to jojo. And in s1, sun oh knew that hye young liked jojo, but even knowing that he went after the same girl. Besides, the growing friendship and love in s2 between hye young and jojo were really satisfying. I really loved it❤️❤️❤️.
