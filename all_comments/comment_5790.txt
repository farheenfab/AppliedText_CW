my theory is that Jojo and Hye-yeong are becoming close and everything and when he said that is says she might like him she smiled and everything. their was also a scene were they were about to kiss but then their was also a scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=60">1:00</a> were is showed that Jojo may not like Hye-yeong anymore which mean she may have stopped liking him and went back to sunoh. And I say this because their is a part we’re she is running with white pants and pink shirt and then their is also a scene where she says “Who do I like” and also they were hugging and Ik it can mean nothing but I do think at the end they will end up together<br><br><del>that’s my theory</del>
