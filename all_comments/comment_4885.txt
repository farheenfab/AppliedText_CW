WORST ENDING EVER. PERIOD IT. Its not like I&#39;m not in the favour of second lead getting the girl but for god sake there was 0 chemistry between Jojo and Hye-hyeong in the season 1. If they wanted to end this like that they should have shown interaction and chemistry between them. First season was all about jojo and sun-oh. On the other hand in true beauty ju kyung had chemistry with both the leads. But not in this drama. Highly disappointed ðŸ’”
