I cant even describe to you how much I love this kiss scene. It&#39;s so controversial compared to other k-dramas because this whole scene is driven by Sun-Oh and JoJo&#39;s lust to want to kiss each other, which is not a common thing to happen in k-dramas. Plus, JoJo had a boyfriend and still went along with kissing him. It&#39;s all about desire. I like this, though. It&#39;s more raw and real and spontaneous.
