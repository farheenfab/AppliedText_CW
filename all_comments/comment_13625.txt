I will just watch the last episode to see if we already knew by the webtoon or they decided to let her stay with her first love. Because tbh she left with unresolved feelings and those feelings have not gone away so is she getting a second chance or is she starting a new chapter. But I vote for none of the guys they both come with baggage she just needs to love herself first without both men.
