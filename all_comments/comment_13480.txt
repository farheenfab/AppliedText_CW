Its Hye yeon for me coz he&#39;s patient and he trust Jojo and most of all his love for Jojo is unconditional..He just want to show Jojo his love and affection without any condition.He&#39;s really mature to handle the situation which is Jojo deserves to have a calm and mature man since she&#39;s been through hell since she was a child..I hope the twist of the story is that they will realize that love alarm is just an app and you should know how you truly feel and choose who you think is the best for you and who you truly love..
