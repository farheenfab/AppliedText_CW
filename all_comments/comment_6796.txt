Okay, so I feel like the only one who likes the second lead more, but it&#39;s mainly because he likes her for who she is<br>Sun-Oh came into the picture quite oddly, wanting to kiss her when he knew she had a boyfriend AND that his best friend liked her<br>Sure, he genuinely began to like her, but so did the other 2 guys (or maybe her boyfriend didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t remember that well)<br>Also, this trailer kinda gave it all away
