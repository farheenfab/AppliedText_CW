I am honestly so confused by all the disappointment. I was team hye yeong during the whole season. Did we see the same drama? He is just so kind and he truly loves her. Let&#39;s normalise good main leads over the usual rich kid/model with anger issues (toxic in my opinion). Plus finally, a show where first love is not endgame. In real life we change feelings, we change partners and that&#39;s how it is. SO REFRESHING.
