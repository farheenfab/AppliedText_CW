If she doesnâ€™t end up with Jung Ga-Ram, I will be extremely upset! He was the one who loved her from the beginning!!!! He respected her and didnâ€™t want to force his love upon her. He simply waited and respected her choices. The other guy needs more soul searching! He needs to find himself to truly know what love is and to understand how love works. He needs to mend his differences with his family and face his personal issues straight on. If she doesnâ€™t choose Jung Ga-Ram, she is as immature as they come. ðŸ’¯
