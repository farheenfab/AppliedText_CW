People see this and they still don’t get why Jojo chose Hye-yeong. 😫 I’d like to break down some points of the series. If you don’t like reading long essays, you may stop here. Hahahaha!<br><br>I watched this clip because this is the part where Jojo realizes it’s Hye-yeong she loves despite Sun-oh kissing her. 😂<br><br>For those putting the blame on Hye-yeong for not confessing first. I replied this as a comment but here it is. The only reason Hye-yeong denied it was because the first time, Jojo was in a relationship with Il-sik. He’s not the type of person who would steal a girl or make the girl’s life complicated. He didn’t know Jojo wasn’t actually in love with Il-sik. He was waiting for her to be single before he made a move.<br><br>The second time was when Sun-oh deliberately kissed Jojo to get a reaction from Hye-yeong while he kept insisting that he tells him the truth (‘cause obviously Sun-oh knew Hye-yeong liked her. Even the driver/PA told him that.), Hye-yeong actually thought Sun-oh really liked her. He said “What about you? Why did you kiss her? I’ll answer your question if you answer mine”. He also told Sun-oh, “No matter how many times you ask, my answer is still the same. I don’t like Kim Jojo BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER.”. Hye-yeong ALWAYS put Sun-oh first since childhood and knowing his bestfriend liked the girl he likes, he backed away. (Very different from what Sun-oh did). Remember when Hye-yeong was talking to Jojo about HS after 4 years and admitting his feelings? He said, “I deleted the Love Alarm because I thought it would make things complicated. But I should’ve just rang your love alarm then.” Again, it wasn’t because he didn’t want to act up on it. He wanted to tell her he liked her. He just considered everyone else’s feelings and situations first. Especially since it involved both Jojo and Sun-oh. Two people he cared most about. 😊<br><br>So really, I don’t think it’s fair for other people to blame Hye-yeong for not confessing first just because Sun-oh was so head on aggressive about his feelings. Sun-oh’s approach was sort of self-centered because he was the type of person who craves attention from what he’s lacking from his family. Hye-yeong was the only person giving him that and he got jealous of Jojo because she was taking Hye-yeong’s attention from him. That’s why he kissed Jojo in the first place. To get a reaction from Hye-yeong. His feelings just developed over time since when Jojo finally rang his love alarm, he wanted so much to keep that love but couldn’t see past the fleeting moments with her.<br><br>As for Jojo’s reason. While I understand that he was trying to do good with his relationship with Jojo during HS, Sun-oh, without realizing it was actually doing these things for himself as well. He wanted to keep Jojo because he felt happy with her. She did mention in season one that even though Sun-oh was good to her there was a line in their convenience store where Sun-oh texted her he’d always ring her love alarm, she said, “I didn’t do anything wrong. But why do I feel so small?” He was blind to what Jojo actually felt and needed. Hye-yeong didn’t need Jojo to tell him what she felt. As he said, “How can I not know, when I can see it so clearly?” <br><br>Sun-oh did care for Jojo. But it was misplaced because he couldn’t understand or see her struggles without her telling him. Even to the last minute, he still can’t figure out Jojo and kept asking her why she broke-up with him or insisting that she still likes him even when Jojo already told him no. He’s been ignorant until the last season where he couldn’t even admit to himself that Jojo already liked Hye-yeong and not him.😅 <br><br>Maybe to other people who are centered on Sun-oh like he is to himself, he looked like the victim and didn’t do anything wrong. But when you’re not the “right one”, it can never be forced. He can’t force Jojo like when he kissed her without her consent and her being in a relationship yet again and with his best friend! 😩 If Hye-yeong did that when he was in a relationship with Jojo, he’d flip. (but we all<br>know that’s not Hye-yeong style). Jojo felt something wrong about their relationship and it wasn’t healthy that’s why she installed the shield and broke-up with him. But she felt more happy and at ease with Hye-yeong. There weren’t so many complications and drama. That’s why she wanted to uninstall the shield and express her feelings to Hye-yeong. 😊😅<br><br>Like in real life, even when you love a person, but you feel incomplete, would you still stay in that relationship when you can be completely happy and healthy with someone else? In a relationship that doesn’t feel like it’s a burden but things just go smoothly? 😅 I mean Jojo was clearly was giving more effort and care with her relationship with Hye-yeong than she did with Sun-oh and she didn’t even feel small or any burden at all. Based on that alone, you could tell who she valued more. Hehe. 😊✌🏼<br><br>As for Hye-yeong being “selfish”. I don’t think that’s fair since Sun-oh did that to him first. Hye-yeong always put Sun-oh first in everything. Even with Jojo in the first season. He didn’t even get mad a Sun-oh for pursuing Jojo. If Sun-oh can express his feelings, why can’t Hye-yeong when Jojo was already single? Sun-oh also denied that he still has feelings for her but HY said “Well, I still do.” He realized he couldn’t let Jojo go so he finally tried when it was the right time. If Sun-oh was a true friend, he would’t get mad at Hye-yeong when Hye-yeong didn’t get mad at him when he came for Jojo. Hye-yeong didn’t abandon Sun-oh. Sun-oh pushed him away because of Jojo. He said “Go to Jojo! But don’t come back here again.” So yeah, I don’t think HY left him by his choice. 😅 why did he try to leave the house? He only rented an apartment because he too was feeling small living in a house that wasn’t his. Also maybe because it would make Sun-oh uncomfortable with him dating Jojo. But it didn’t mean he wanted to stop being friends with Sun-oh. He didn’t have ill feelings with him. It was the other way around. 😊<br><br>However, I do think it was a good touch that they still gave Sun-oh maturity towards the last episode with his relationship with his mom, how he finally accepted the truth about Jojo and how he treated Yukjo. 👍🏼<br><br>The End. 😂
