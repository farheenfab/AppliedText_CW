Omg!!! Finally!!!! I am <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamsunoh">#TeamSunOh</a> and I will forever be rooting for JoJo and Sun Oh because their love was cut short and they are each other’s first loves.. however, judging by this trailer, I really think they are going to follow the web toon... JoJo will most likely ring Hye Young’s alarm at the end when she realizes that her feelings for Sun Oh aren’t the same.. and he will probably accept it and embrace the other girl... the girl that walks away when he yells “You still love me” isn’t JoJo... I think it’s the other girl... breaks my heart but I don’t think JoJo and Sun Oh are end game :(
