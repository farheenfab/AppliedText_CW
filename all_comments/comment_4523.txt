@ people that say Hyeyoung and Jojo have no chemistry ðŸ¤¡ ðŸ¤¡ BRUH THAT BACK HUG SCENE AND KISS ON HIS CHEEK HAD ME SQUEAL SO FUXKING HARD. And WHEN he shared a tiny ass umbrella with her despite having his own. And that mf bridge scene??? THE CUTE HEAD BUMP AND THE TIE SCENE. Yâ€™all are freaking blind . The head bump alone did WAYYY more for me then Sunohâ€™s abrupt kiss in season 1 ,
