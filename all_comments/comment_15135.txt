Why all of the comments are saying that THEY NEED SUNJO IN THE END BECAUSE IF NOT, THEY WILL BE HEART BROKEN. What does it mean? Do you finished reading the Love Alarm in Webtoon?? PLEASE ANSWER ME<br>:(  I&#39;M CONFUSED.<br><br>PS: SUNJO in the end or don&#39;t make a Season 2 if they will not end up together. They have a GREAT GREAT CHEMISTRY than Hye Yeong. Sorry to HYEJO Shippers out there. Hehe.
