im honestly so mad. netflix knows a lot of fans wants sun oh and jojo together. they couldve changed the ending!!! i know in the webtoon she ended up with hyeyeong but for example look at &quot;true beauty&quot; (kdrama), they changed the plot a lot regardless what was in the webtoon.<br>[edit: the webtoon didnt stopped when hyeyeong and jojo ends up together. in the webtoon, it continues with sun oh also installing the spear (i read somewhere)]
