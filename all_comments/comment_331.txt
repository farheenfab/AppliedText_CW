I started hating this series for not ending up with the exact pair,ðŸ˜”ðŸ¤§that really broke me.if you are a person who needs a drama with a true love dont watch this!! I hated it because she loved and gave up for no reason and ended up with some one else I mean like seriously what were they thinking to give?? Who all think that sun oh and jojo made a good pair? And wanted them together.Sunoh was honest and loyal but then y did jojo even break it. So sorry i hated the endingðŸ˜£
