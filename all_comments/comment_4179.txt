It&#39;s either one could have been chosen:<br>1. Sun Oh x Jojo (a public demand bcoz of the actors&#39; strong chemistry but might lose the essense and message behind the drama)<br>2. Hyeyeong x Jojo (brings an in-depth mature message but might lose the drama&#39;s popularity, get low ratings, and receive bad feedbacks)<br><br>Good thing the production team respects the original â™¡ I love Love Alarm not only bcoz the girl got to end up with a better guy, but how deep the message could be imparted from it. I&#39;m one of those minorities who liked the season 2 * cheers *
