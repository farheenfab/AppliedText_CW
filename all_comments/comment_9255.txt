The Second Lead Syndrome is real with this drama. Hye-young deserves so much more, a better friend and someone who doesn&#39;t see him as a second choice. Hope they don&#39;t just use him as a tool to make Jojo realise her feelings and leave him heartbroken but still supportive of his friend and crush.. <br><br>LIKE COME ON, second leads deserve the world!
