First of all, the original webtoon is not completed yet. The new episodes are still coming out. If the writer wanted Hye young and Jojo as the end game, then why is she still drawing new episodes. The webtoon could just be ended in 2018 when jojo and hye young rang each other s alarm. Also, in the latest episode, Jojo met Sunoh unexpectedly on the street, then she almost cried bc sunoh was not ringing her alarm anymore. I think the author was trying to say that our heart and feelings are sth that we can’t control. <br>So I don’t know how this will be reflected in the drama but it only makes sense if it’s Jojo and Sunoh endgame
