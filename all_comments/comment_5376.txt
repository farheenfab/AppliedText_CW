Saw spoilers about the ending. An absolute waste of time, not going to watch season 2. Sun-ho wasn&#39;t even given a reason why. Why did Netflix waste all that time into knowing viewers&#39; preference? I did not wait 2 years for this. No hate to the artists who were just doing their job but the direction the story took is a disaster. Not gonna watch. Great job Netflix! You really didn&#39;t need to waste time and effort to make this season. All you did was glorify stalking, because that&#39;s what Hye yeong&#39;s feelings were about until he finally had a conversation with Jojo 4 years after high school. Sorry, but I can&#39;t enjoy any show which rewards a character for having feelings that started as nothing but stalking and one-sided obsession. Oh, and add lying to the list bcs Hye Yeong constantly lied, even to Sun-ho in school when he asked if he had feelings for Jo-jo. He didn&#39;t say anything until after Jo-jo&#39;s attraction for Sun-ho was confirmed with their kiss. Truly disappointed. Cannot sympathise with a male lead like that. They didn&#39;t have to make a character who did that as the male lead this season. Just bcs he has endless patience, doesn&#39;t excuse all the times he was a selfish and terrible friend to Sun-ho and the way he held an unhealthy obsession with Jojo, because I don&#39;t understand how he loved her since high school when he never even knew her as a person? That&#39;s delusional and an obsession. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to like the very foundation of the Hye-Jo relationship. He essentially stalked her and kept following her until she finally decided to date him for no good reason at the end of season 1.
