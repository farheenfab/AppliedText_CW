I don&#39;t know why can&#39;t people see hye yeong&#39;s love for jojo. Why can&#39;t they see how much hye yeong suffered?? All they see is handsome face of sunoh(no hates but their fans are making me angry) Hye yeong deserve jojo much more than sun oh. Also there is so much chemistry between hye and jojo. Y&#39;all be acting like hye yeong is not a good person or he didn&#39;t suffer or his love is weakðŸ˜‘ what i want to say is hye yeong and jojo is also a great couple. If you actually see than you guys can see the love between hye and jojo. Also this drama is not a flop.
