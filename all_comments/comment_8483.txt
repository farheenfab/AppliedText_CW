It&#39;s so unfair for Sun-oh to be left like that just bec Jojo didn&#39;t have the courage to fall in love and be with him. To think that he already felt rejected and unloved by his parents. It&#39;s a good thing this is only a fiction, bec in reality, the memory of what she done to Sun-oh will forever haunt her even if she ends up falling in love with Hye-yeong.
