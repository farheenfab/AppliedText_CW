Towards the last episodes I was feeling so disappointed because it really seemed like Jojo was gonna end up with Sunoh, but I was extremely happy when she chose Hyeyoung at the end. It was so refreshing to see a protagonist choosing the better guy and not the rich, hot one with toxic behaviors. Hyeyoung was the best guy from the very beginning, when Sunoh went and kissed the girl he knew his best friend liked he still supported him and never intervened in their relationship at all. And then with Jojo, he was very patient and attentive even if her indecisiveness hurt him, he was always very understanding with her. He was just such a good friend and kind person in general. Unlike Sunoh, who was selfish and immature. Yes Jojo wronged him and I feel kinda bad for that but his way of approaching her was not the best, not to mention how unnecessarily mean he was to Hyeyoung after everything he did for him his whole life, even when it was painful for him. And not only to them, but I didn&#39;t like the way he treated other people (excluding their parents they deserved it lol), hey at least he wasn&#39;t shit to Yukjo ig. Anyways, Sunoh fans should open their eyes and realize that Jojo choosing Hyeyoung was the most mature, healthy decision.
