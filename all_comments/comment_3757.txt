I just finished watching S1. And I&#39;ve read countless of comments about HyeYoung vs SunOh and I&#39;ve come to conclusion that, JOJO IS NOT THE PRIZE. HyeYoung is the prize really, whoever gets to have HyeYoung by their side wins. <br><br>I don&#39;t think many of us realise how toxic both Jojo and Sun Oh are. They both obviously can&#39;t let go of each other and in that process they are hurting other (including HyeYoung ofc and YukJo). <br><br>Everything was fine when they were dating eachother. I still see no sense in her breaking up with SunOh. And she realises that too, that&#39;s why she wants to get rid of that shield. But I hate the fact that she is leading HyeYoung on. <br><br>SunOh is such a brat. He literally wants everything he sets his eyes upon. He is not emotionally mature, even at that age. But his emotions are pure ðŸ¥º. <br><br>HYEYOUNG DESERVES BETTER (way better partner than Jojo)<br><br>SunOhxJojo for world peace
