The comments here are making me sad. This is what happens when you have a shipping goggles on when watching a drama. Comments are just biased and discrediting the people behind who worked hard on Love Alarm. I normally don&#39;t leave comments like this, but I am comepelled to do so.<br><br>To the team of Love Alarm, thank you for giving us this wonderful drama! I thoroughly enjoyed every scene. I cried when scenes are sad. I smiled when scenes are lovely. I was frustrated when there was indecisiveness. I fell in love when there were fluttering scenes. You guys left on an amazing note! I am drunk on Love Alarm and would rewatch again and again. Thank you, Love Alarm!
