Jesus.. Everyone is crying here because she ended up with Hyeong. Well, that just proves that I was right to stop watching the series at episode 6 season 1. I couldnt stomach myself to watch how could she let go of Sun oh just like that. Hyeong may be good but for me, its always Sun oh. He is such a warm, cute and caring guy. He never shied away from expressing his love towards her from day 1. He was so sure about his love and what he wanted in his life. He let go of his pride and admitted that he is jealous. He even begged her to stay with him. Where would I find someone like him who would love me with all my flaws.?? Am not saying he is perfect but for me he is perfect in my own world.
