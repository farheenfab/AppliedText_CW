I don&#39;t know which ship I was on, I liked both. i&#39;m sure. i like Sun oh, i like Hye yeong too. they have their own extraordinary charm. I was very happy with Jojo&#39;s love for Sun Oh in the first season, but I&#39;m also sad for Hye-yeong. I&#39;m really looking forward to season two, I wish everyone all the best. Jojo, Sun oh, Hye yeong, and all the viewers who love their story. thanks for season two!<br><br>From this trailer, I feel happy seeing Hye Yeong smile a lot. I think he will find his happiness in this season.<br><br>Hye yeong just like Gong taegwang (who are you: school 2015), they were an guardian angel. Their love is sincere, and only the heart of their soulmate was the most important, their love is not aggressive.<br><br>but Sun oh still loves Jojo.. how about this.. T________T<br><br>OH I&#39;M SO EXITED!^^^^^
