It&#39;s just sad to see all the &quot;fans&quot; complaining about jojo not getting together with sun-oh. Of course she didn&#39;t. He made her feel uncomfortable most of the time, didn&#39;t listen to her, didn&#39;t think about her, he treated hye-young, his long term best friend who was always there for hime like shit. Hye-young loves jojo unconditionally, that&#39;s obvious. He made her feel good about herself. So of course she chose him. Don&#39;t be butthurt just because she chose the one that loves her the most, not the one that&#39;s the most beautiful. It&#39;s a realistic ending. Love Alarm is like black mirror, it shows us the dark side of fame, social media and modern society - but also that true and unconditional love still exists. And I think that&#39;s just beautiful. The show gave me back my hope in humanity - that people do the right thing because they want to and that good looks aren&#39;t everything.
