I respect all of the opinions but I really want JoJo and Sun-ho back like in the first season. I don&#39;t know how to feel right now. The trailer confused me. At the moment she was with Hye-yeong and at the other moment Sun-ho and JoJo kissed. Than she said she didn&#39;t know who she likes more? I&#39;m so confused. 😵🥴😅As other said that at the end of the webtoon Jojo didn&#39;t end up with Sun-oh but come on let the series end with Sun-ho and JoJo. Don&#39;t make it like the webtoon. PLEASE! I know they&#39;ve already recorded but please I want the ending with Sun-ho and JoJo🙈🥺💜❤️
