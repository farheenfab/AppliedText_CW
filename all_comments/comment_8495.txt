<b>DEAR JOJO,</b><br><br><i>You better not turn our gentle baby Hyeyeong into a rebound, a temporary replacement to fill the empty space Sun-Oh has left because I swear to god i willl break the fourth wall just to untie your shoelaces and steal your umbrella, every waking moment of your life. Careful, hun.</i> <br><br><br><b>Sincerely,</b><br><b>The Minority Who Adores Hyeyeong</b>
