I will kill the script writter if the there is no Love Alarm 3 with kim jojo and sun-oh together!!! It&#39;s 2AM, I&#39;m still saddddd.<br><br>I cried, while jojo calling her mother on bridge. But at the end, &quot;I&#39;m leaving you not because i hate you. You are just too heavy. It&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault. &quot; - something like that was painful and true :((
