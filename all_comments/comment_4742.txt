I watch light romance kdrama to have fun, to feel heartfluttering moment, not to be remind that everything has to be realistic and logical. Thats why, when i dont see the chemistry between jojo and hyeyoung, i am disappointed. I feel like jojo choose the safest option for her, she doesnt really love him sincerely. He love me, he always there for me, so i should respect his feeling and try to like him back. Well, thats real life for you, but for me, this is drama, light romance drama at that, and i watch this to escape from reality, so i just want to watch character who love each other naturally, not forcing it because of logical reason. Thats why i am not ready for this kind of story in season 2 when i was hyped by overflowing sunoh jojo chemistry in season 1. Ok, people will come to me for this comment, but whatever... I will treat this series like i treat lovers in paris and reply 1988...
