I guess I&#39;m one of the few in the world who really ships Jojo and Hye-yeong and is happy with the ending. <br><br>As a teenager I would&#39;ve wanted J to end up with S. But as an adult I found myself wanting J to end up with H. When I looked at both male lead&#39;s and I asked myself who would I want to spend the rest of my life with I found myself choosing H. His love is mature, patient, and kind. <br><br>As you get older you will realize that not everyone ends up with their first love. They will always hold a special place in your heart but sometimes people change and you have to move on.
