I&#39;m no team but I&#39;m pretty sure more than half of the ppl who support sun ho is for his looks. Like I get that he&#39;s all cute and stuff but what he did in the beginning of the few eps it was totally wrong.Knowing his best friend liked her first , he still kissed her even tho he had no feelings for her at that time. Smh how do ppl actually found that romantic and all like that&#39;s pretty disturbing.
