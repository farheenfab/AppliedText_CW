Ya&#39;ll. I think the trailer is already telling us she&#39;ll end up with Sun Oh. First -- the onscreen text. &quot;Let me listen to your heart. Love comes ringing AGAIN.&quot; That only points to Sun Oh and JoJo&#39;s relationship. And then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=57">00:57</a>,  SHE is leaning that extra 1% to kiss him (remember how important that was from S1). And if you look closely,  right after the kiss @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=60">1:00</a> on Hye Yeong&#39;s phone, the number goes from 236,587 to 236,586, which means that there is one less person who has the potential to like him. Although they don&#39;t show who that person is, the person/image disappearing  resembles JoJo. I can&#39;t read Korean, but i think the name says &quot;Kim JoJo&quot; too. I just noticed the last two letters are the same, for &quot;Jo Jo.&quot; lolol. Plus, why would he want to check on anyone else besides her? lol.
