i felt so happy when so hyun nuna, my favourite actress, finally get to ring hye yeong&#39;s love alarm, and end up together with someone she loves. it is quite tormenting to see how she was unable to ring either sun oh or hye yeong&#39;s love alarms with that shield hindering her ability to ring for not just one, but a goddamn four years before this.
