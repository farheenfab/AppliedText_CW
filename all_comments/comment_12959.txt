I&#39;m just happy to see that hyeyeong finally has the opportunity to fight for the girl she likes, he was always so selfless, even when he was hurting he still chose to protect her from the distance and to respect his friend even though the friend in question never respected him in the first place. to the b*tches  hating on hyeyeong, catch me outside how about that?? <br>anyways, if Jojo doesn&#39;t see how amazing he is, I do my boy! come to me pls
