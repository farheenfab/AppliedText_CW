Season 2 was so unfair with Sun Ho. He loved Jojo so much, made her happy , she too felt that and always thanked him for that but then for her own sake without any reason Jojo dumped him. Sun ho didn&#39;t even got to know, why she did that to him. Sun oh begged her “like me again” that was way too depressing. Jojo’s sheild made Sun Ho suffer for nothing ,and all of a sudden after 4 years she wanted to remove the sheild for someone else. That’s so disgusting.I hated Kim Jo-Jo. [SEASON-2 :FRUSTRATING, DISAPPOINTING]
