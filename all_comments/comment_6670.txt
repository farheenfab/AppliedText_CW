The series mostly showed us those unnecessary romantic subplots, that it came to the point where we are forgetting that this is a drama too. That trauma and mental health is a major factor in Jojo&#39;s decision-making.<br><br>Growing up with suicidal parents who&#39;d also take their own child&#39;s life with them? I can&#39;t imagine the effects and list of mental illnesses the child could get from those traumatic experiences.<br><br>It&#39;s very hard to sympathize with something that we didn&#39;t experience for ourselves. But I can safely say that it&#39;s freaking tough and it sucks to be in Jojo&#39;s situation. I&#39;m not sure if this series tackles mental health issues but I hope they do.
