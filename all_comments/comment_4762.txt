What a horrible let down in season 2!!!! This didn’t make sense one bit. So in season 1, she put up the shield b/c she loved Sung oh so much she didn’t want to be hurt by him. You could see their chemistry and love in their characters. <br><br>So in season 2, the cat is out of the bag about the shield and that’s how they end it?! WTH??? I’m so mad I spent my time watching this season. Just horrible. <br><br><b>***SPOILER ALERT***</b><br>Jojo denies her feelings of Sung ho and settles for the nice guy and Sung ho goes back to his ex-girlfriend who he dumped and tries to force some feelings for her and she looks so grateful to be someone’s leftover prize. Ugh....hated this season and ending.
