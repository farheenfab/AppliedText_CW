SPOILER<br><br><br><br>At first I was really upset that she didn&#39;t end up with Sun Oh, but now honestly I don&#39;t even care about who she ended up with. The worst thing is that Sun Oh did literally nothing wrong but she directed all those hurtful words to him (wdym you set up the shield bc of Sun Oh it was literally bc of your own inferiority complex), looked at him like he was the one troubling her (girl. If you want him to stop coming back to you give him some effing closure) and even till the end he wasn&#39;t given a proper closure on their relationship. Why is he the only one who has to be trapped in the past? Why is he the one burdened with all the pain all these years just bc she, while convincing herself that this is so she wouldn&#39;t hurt him, tried to escape her own complex and couldn&#39;t be bothered to explain her reasons? Why did he have to end up with someone he didn&#39;t like? I like Yook Jo I just feel like if they had to end up together, if the scriptwriter could make Jojo fall in love with Hye Yeong based on effort, then why not do the same for Sun Oh. At least give him a happy ending that he actually can get genuine happiness out of. I just feel so bad for him. If I had known it would end like this maybe I wouldn&#39;t even have clicked on S1.
