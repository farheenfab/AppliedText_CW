Basically jojo is saying sunoh makes her want to hide from her problems whereas hyeyoung makes her want to face her problems. Hyeyoung is the type of guy that girls will want to settle down with bc he is mature, whereas sunoh is the type of guy that girls dream of dating 💕 bless for making such an awesome drama ❤️❤️
