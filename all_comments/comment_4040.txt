This is so heartbreaking I should’ve watched the first episode and scrolled down to the last episode just to see how it was going to end like I usually does. I am glad I have books to read to not hold on this for long. Very disappointed at least they could’ve make Sun-oh fall in love with that actress the pain would’ve been less for me. I will not watch season 3 not happy.
