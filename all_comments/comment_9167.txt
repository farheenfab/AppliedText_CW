omg i hate that i know my heart&#39;s gonna break so bad for hye young. i&#39;ve liked him from the 1st season. dude&#39;s cool but people like the main lead more(obviously).. yet another drama i wish would have the other guy get the girl. reminds me of jisoo in a few of his dramas being 2nd lead where his character is obviously better than the lead but you obviously won&#39;t get the girl. i hope this drama has a twist. break the cycle of k drama stereotypes.
