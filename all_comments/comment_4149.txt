*SPOILER ALERT *<br><br>FINALLY! 2nd lead gets the girl. <br>no matter how most people ship Sun Oh &amp; Jojo in season 1, I still think Hye Yeong is a better match for Jojo. Sun Oh is a douche for going for his best friend&#39;s crush in the first place. and he relies too much on Love Alarm and he&#39;s kinda pushy. Hye Yeong really cares about Jojo and love her.  kind and patience as well. that&#39;s the kind of guy you should be with in the long run
