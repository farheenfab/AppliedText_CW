Okay... okay thats it jojo is a bishhh ( excuse the rudeness please), she knows sooo well inside her heart no matter how much she denies it it&#39;ll always be sun-oh... so why raise lee&#39;s hopes up?! Even if he&#39;s persistent and pushy that he&#39;ll wait for her... bruh turn him down. Ughhh!!! Piece of advise jojo honey, why don&#39;t you first try to fix/ get ur sh*t together before getting  into &quot;new&quot; relationship. <br>What&#39;s really sad is that. .. because of ONE hecking gurlll sun-oh and lee&#39;s relationship might broken.
