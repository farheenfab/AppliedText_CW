I think Hye-yeong will be the right choice. I really loved them as well but like she said it&#39;s in the past, and you can&#39;t change it. This is making this scene even more heartbreaking. You can tell by her tears that she already made the decision to break up with him. At that point her life has been too much of a mess that she had to process on her own. She couldn&#39;t have given him what he deserved at that time. But you can&#39;t change what happened. It&#39;s such a realistic portrayal of what love is in real life.
