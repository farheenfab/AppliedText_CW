I&#39;m gonna call it right now.. she ends up with HY. The scene at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=50">0:50</a> looks like she finally rings his love alarm, his face shows relief and &quot;omg, finally&quot;. Also... NetflixKr&#39;s channel has individual trailers for both SO and HY and you can see SO hugging a shorter, black colored hair girl at the end AND HE&#39;S SMILING. Like he finally accepted his gf and moved on
