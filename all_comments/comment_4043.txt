imagine having a relationship that stresses you out so much..think of the time she said &quot;you were just too heavy&quot;. think of it deeply....Looking back at the past, jojo and sun ho really loved each other, but this doesn&#39;t mean that they still belong until the end. Love grows, love stays, love develops..love is something that we should work hard for and love is made with sacrifices too. &quot;Faith in machines&quot;, this taught us that we shouldn&#39;t be dependent on the app which rings when you love someone or what..its about our own will and choices. I like the ending, it talks about the reality of moving on and going forward. Jojo dealt with so much pain, she deserves that happiness. The love and happiness which brings lightness to her life.
