Hyeyong is too perfect while sunoh is relatable. He was not selfish if he wanted to know the reason why jojo left him. She broke up with him without any explanation. Its natural for him to search for answers. I don&#39;t understand why many people are saying sunoh is toxic. He is just a normal human being with flaws. I don&#39;t think sunoh and jojo would have lasted coz jojo hates the attention of people and being with sunoh is something that grabs attention. If only jojo had a normal childhood and sunoh&#39;s parents weren&#39;t that controlling and sunoh wasn&#39;t a public figure sunoh and jojo would have lasted. Given the situation hyeyong was perfect for jojo. But I think sunoh and jojo&#39;s relationship is epic because they didn&#39;t end up together. I can understand hyeyong but I couldn&#39;t feel his emotions coz he was unimaginably perfect. I could feel every emotion sunoh felt coz he seemed relatable. I cried in every scene sunoh and jojo were together  <br>P.S sorry if my comment contained spoilers I felt the need to share this somewhere I am tired of people saying sunoh is toxic and felt the need to let my feelings out
