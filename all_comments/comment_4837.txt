[SPOILER ALERT]<br>[TEAM SUN-OH]<br>Okay, so I waited a whole freaking year to watch the season 2 of love alarm so that I can watch Jojo and Sun-oh ending up together but since I had a offline exam in morning of 13, so I didn&#39;t  watch the season 2 and now I saw a spoiler that hye-yeong is the one jojo end up with..<br>I AM LITERALLY SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW THAT I AM NOT GOING TO WATCH SEASON 2..<br>What the hell is going on with the writers, when we want the second lead to get the girl, the first one always get the girl and now that we were all happy for sun-oh, the story is changed...<br>The 2nd lead from startup or school 2015 should have got the girl, not from love alarm....
