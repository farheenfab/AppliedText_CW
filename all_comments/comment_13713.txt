this season 2 hasn’t start yet but just like other romance kdrama,i can see jojo will be ended up with sun oh. as hyeyoung team, it’s going to be so frustrating. Because in kdrama universe, the first choice (sun oh) will always win no matter what. but if she ended up with hyeyoung, istg the writer is great at not making some cliche turns.
