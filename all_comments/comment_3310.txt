Like I don&#39;t get those people who say they want Jojo to end up with Hyeyeong? He is definitely a great, nice guy who tries to help jojo and finally mustered some courage to confess to her. But we can SEE, WITH OUT BARE EYES that Jojo is forcing herself not to like Seono, and the steps she took to do that are 1. Lock her love alarm app with the shield dukgu gifted her, 2. Tagging herself with Hyeyeong. Between her and seono, the amount of emotions in their eyes just when they stare at each other, they smile at each other, their freakin chemistry is out of the world. I guess there&#39;s still a team hyeyeong, and there are chances season 2 will have him as the main lead, like the webtoon has, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever stop talking about Seono-Jojo.
