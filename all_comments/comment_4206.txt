At first I was mad and disappointed when I saw the second season, but the more I think about it, I understand it. If we talk about the plot without having the faces of the actors (influence of their attractiveness), sun oh was so toxic from the start - he stalked the girl his best friend liked for a very long period of time and he broke the bro code. Hye yeong has loved Jojo and supported her through many ups and downs (even from afar). He showed maturity and pure and unconditional love. I think he deserved so much love. What I DIDNâ€™T like was that Jojo never direct told Sun oh the reason for their break up and was too focused on removing the shield. Hye yeong deserved even more than her immature and indecisive self.
