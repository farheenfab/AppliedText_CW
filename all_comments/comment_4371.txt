Jojo did the right choice!! With sunho she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable how they attract people&#39;s attention she hated it , while with hye young he never ask for her to much never force her. Well You will understand if you don&#39;t skip the episodes, sun oh has a strong character but he deserves someone better.
