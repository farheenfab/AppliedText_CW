This is quite long but i feel that&#39;s important so hopefully yall read it. <br><br>I feel that the director is teaching us the repercussions of bad communication skills and expression, there are a lot of people leading with their own demons and insecurities which makes it hard for them when initiating a relationship(its not an excuse for hurting bc they don&#39;t mean it but we can be at bit more understanding even if they dont open up at first) , not only about having a bf but in friendship as well. <br><br>We can see that at first with Jojo and her ex friend, she didn&#39;t mean to and her ex friend wasn&#39;t understanding so thats why fixing it was harder. So let&#39;s be a little more understanding even if its frustrating to see Jojo be indecisive, it&#39;s not that easy, i really hope she opens her heart more and understands that despite being hurt she still has people that care for her.<br><br>Also guys if you are dealing with suppressing your feelings or afraid to open up try to little by little and never forget that even if there aren&#39;t many people willing to actually listen, there&#39;s always someone with a kind heart to understand you. Even in the comment section you can make friends. Wish you tons of love and always TPWK!
