Bad, lazy writing. I think I could accept it if the season is logic and if Jojo character is better. But Sun-Oh literally hasnt get a chance, Jojo already loved H. when the season strarted. He just cried over another season. If they want this from the begining, why they pick Song Kang for the role (hurting more? Xd), they chemistry was too good for this, they had to be show that something is not perfect, thats not written in the stars etc (come on, when they first look each other, my heart melted). Sun-Oh is not perfect but his whole story was made for just Jojo&#39;s story arc. He just suffer 2 season and get a tiny happinnes. I am so sad that he suffered a  lot and I think Jojo had to explain more things for him. PS: Yukjo is golden but we will never see again the really happy Sun-Oh (do you remember that, right? When jojo told him She loves him, ouch) :( but I am really happy for Song Kang, maybe the whole thing is his fault üòÅ because I think he is a good actor, handsome of course but I belive him every tear, act and love, maybe because of this is more difficult for the fans. Song Kang is the winner for this show, not Sun-Oh and I can be happy for that, but sadly thats all
