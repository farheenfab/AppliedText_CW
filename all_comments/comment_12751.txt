You&#39;ll saying that Hyeyeong deserves it what about sun-oh , jojo left him without even saying the real reason why she left him . You were just focusinng on hye yeong and not minding sun oh anymore , you&#39;ll thinking about hyeyeong sacrifices and not caring about sun oh anymore. Yeah jojo can pick whomever she wants but at least she must not left sun oh hanging like that and be happy with other man . No hate just opinion
