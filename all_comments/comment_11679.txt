A point I don&#39;t understand<br>At least jojo should give sun oh a tangible reason as to why she broke up with him and why she suddenly claims she doesn&#39;t like him again <br>Cos the guy is deeply hurt and why is that we can&#39;t see that. He has tried  his possible best to understand and after all this heartbreak, he still loves her <br>Like how many people can do this<br>If this is not true love then it&#39;s what. <br><br>A normal person would just totally forget her cos she has caused him pain  but he is still stuck on her <br><br>Like sun oh please find better love ğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œjust know I&#39;m rooting for your happiness , just your happiness
