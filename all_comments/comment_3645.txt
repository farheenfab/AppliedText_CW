I&#39;ve been an avid fan of Song Kang and have binged on almost all of his notable lead roles in K-dramas. He&#39;s an exceptionally talented actor, and I&#39;ve been consistently impressed by his performances.<br><br>&#39;Love Alarm&#39; truly captured my heart with its compelling storyline and Song Kang&#39;s remarkable acting. I share your sentiments about the ending; I, too, hoped for Sun Oh and Kim Jojo to be the endgame, and their separation was heart-wrenching.His ability to convey emotions, particularly through his expressive eyes, is truly remarkable.<br><br>I&#39;m not only a fan of his work but also follow his social media accounts, including Instagram, to keep up with his career and life. I&#39;m eagerly anticipating more K-dramas, movies, and television series from Song Kang. He&#39;s a phenomenal talent, and I can&#39;t wait to see what he brings to his future projects.<br><br>I also had the pleasure of watching &#39;Nevertheless,&#39; and the chemistry between Song Kang and Han So-Hee was outstanding. Song Kang&#39;s passion and talent were evident, and I became deeply attached to his character. His dedication to his roles and the quality of his work are truly admirable. I appreciate his contributions to the world of K-dramas and look forward to more of his amazing performances.
