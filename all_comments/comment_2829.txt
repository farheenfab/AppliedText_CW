I still can’t get over this drama bcs I never expect that it will end just exactly like I wish. Many people still doesn’t understand WHY she ended with hyeyeong. As an adult, I TOO would prefer hyeyeong rather that sunoh. sunoh is still a kid. he act and think like a kid. a total opposite to hyeyeong. he think maturely for the sake of others. he helped jojo to overcome her trauma, be there for her whenever he needs her. I wish ppl just stop being salty about how sunoh should ended up with jojo.
