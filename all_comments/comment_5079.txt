I&#39;m disappointed and very sorry to have waited all this time for this drama, it was like throwing it in the trash a year of my life, Netflix disappointed me a lot, I believe it had everything to give the best outcome in the series, I sincerely so hoped to see the happy ending of jojo and sun, but with each episode I watched it was like a knife in my heart!
