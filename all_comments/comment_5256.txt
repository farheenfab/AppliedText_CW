I am in the same boat with everyone else. I understand what the director and writer trying to say. Season 1 was fabulous and many people were so in love with it. After watching Season 2, this hurts us a lot. So sad to see the ending that everyone hated. You don&#39;t know what we all wanted? BS. I agree we need to sue nextflix. I agree that they could have done this better. They probably have known all along what ending the Love Alarm fans wanted. They should have made Jojo to make her decision better. Keep the same intention at the end - overcome obstacle and choose too. They could have made Sun Oh to try his way and he could have done a lot to overcome the circumstances and be a better person that Jojo can rely on. It doesn&#39;t make sense that they cannot make our preferred ending as a choice. I keep saying the same thing, but they could have done this better. We need a different Season 2. I will forget that this Season 2 was never made. I will keep watching Season 1 and hope that there will be a better Season 2.
