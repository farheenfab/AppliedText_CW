i think hyeyong is nice and all, but jojo and sun ohâ€™s chemistry... iâ€™m so sad they didnâ€™t end up together. tbh, hyeyong felt like a replacement at first, jojo may have developed feelings later on, but it seemed like he stalked her in season 2 until she gave him a chance. and we all know that sun oh isnâ€™t really in love with yukjo, he stayed with her because he couldnâ€™t have jojo. i want sunjo so bad, s2 is nonexistent to meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
