I didn&#39;t like season 2 bcoz it seemed that the storyline went way fast and unexpected. Though I love who Jojo ended up with (coz I would choose someone as understanding and mature as Hyeyeong). Her story with Hyeyeong is much pure and sincere... and it really manifested the developed love without the reliability of Love Alarm (since Jojo has shield). And Hyeyeong was really an understanding guy even when he&#39;s hurting and all.<br><br>Though my ship has sailed, this season disappointed me. I hated Jojo all throughout the season 2. I felt so bad with the two guys esp. Sun Oh who didn&#39;t get a proper explanation (though it&#39;s settled). They made Duk Gu as a key character just to solve the conflict? Above all, I&#39;ve been crying my heart out bcoz of Yuk Jo. Hope that she&#39;ll be loved back ♡<br><br>But yeah, Hyeyeong x Jojo moments are beautiful ♡
