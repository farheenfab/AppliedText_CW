I srsly don&#39;t understand why people want Sun Oh and Jojo together. He didn&#39;t even know who Jojo was as a person when he kissed her. All he knew was that his best friend liked her and that she had a bf. And he still thinks he&#39;s fit to be hye yong&#39;s best friend? Then when Jojo breaks up with him, he refuses to let her go. Here I do believe Jojo should&#39;ve explained why she left him but he still has no right to force her to tell him the reason. Plus their relationship was straight up TOXIC. I&#39;m glad Jojo left Sun oh. Ik she loved him BUT being in a relationship where you constantly feel insecure is not healthy. She said it herself that she felt so small when she was with him. For her sake, I&#39;m glad she left him. All Sun Oh cares about is HIMSELF and HIS FEELINGS. Now I&#39;m not saying he didn&#39;t love her. Ofc he did after all she was his first love since he comes from a loveless family. BUT even whne Jojo doesn&#39;t ring his alarm anymore(We know why but he doesn&#39;t) he refuses to let her go. <br><br>Then when Hye Yong decides to go after Jojo, he calls him a Bastard? Like are you freaking kidding me? You&#39;ve broken up with her so you have no right to stop him. And for ffs have some decency, Hye yong liked her before you did. He srsly told Hye yong that he used him all his life? Omg, he was so rude and insensitive. <br><br>Don&#39;t even get me started on the blond girl. Poor her. It is so wrong for Sun Oh to date her when he doesn&#39;t even love her. He should let her go but no. He keeps her and has the guts to tell Jojo that she still likes him in his car.<br><br>My point is Sun Oh isn&#39;t a bad guy but he is like a child. He doesn&#39;t know when to let go of things and only cares about his feelings. I&#39;m sure he does it unintentionally but that still doesn&#39;t justify his actions. He will keep on throwing tantrums until he gets what he wants.
