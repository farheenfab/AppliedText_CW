Honestly this was just a disappointing drama. I have loved almost every kdrama I&#39;ve watched except this one. They first season is still good and they&#39;re actually building up the story and characters. The second season is a huge disappointment. There is no real character development. Especially Kim Jo Jo. Her character is absolutely dull and most of the things that could&#39;ve just been fixed if she talked a little. They made big issues out of nothing. They built the whole story around her and sun oh in the first season for it to literally be dismissed completely in the second.  There&#39;s hardly any real confusion on her part even so I don&#39;t see what the point was to even pretend like she was confused. The second season is really not worth your time. Just stick to the first and I would recommend watching something else.
