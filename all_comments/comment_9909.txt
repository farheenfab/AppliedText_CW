I don’t get why people think Sun oh is toxic or that Hye yeong is a better choice. Sun oh literally did nothing wrong to Jojo, he was always patient with her he understood she had a past and never forced her to open up to him instead he comforted her when she needed it even with out him realizing it. I understand people like HY better but to say Sun oh is toxic that’s a reach lol
