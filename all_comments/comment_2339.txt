Don&#39;t want a season 3 because Jojo is better with hye yeong. Don&#39;t come to argue with me. She just simply don&#39;t deserve to be with sunho...she literally run away when he got hurt which totally explains why she ended up with hye yeong. She didn&#39;t even think about once that no matter how long hye yeong waited...sunho was the one who was always there to comfort her, at this point waiting doesn&#39;t matter. Sunho might look selfish but doesn&#39;t it weird too that hye yeong have all his chances that he could take before sunho came but still back away, I swear to god the way he waited it will take ages to confess, Jojo must have been married to someone else by nowðŸ’€ If I was Jojo I wouldn&#39;t even try to love hye yeong because I already love sunho (don&#39;t get offended, if you like hye yeong then that&#39;s great, it&#39;s your life). I don&#39;t like Jojo at all, her character seems really messed up. I can confirm if there was also a car accident happened with hye yeong, she would have left him tooðŸ™‚ I still understand hye yeong, he was really shy...too much shy which isn&#39;t good. Yes, sunho was selfish because he take hye yeong&#39;s chances away and wanted to stay by her side rather then watching her from afar. It&#39;s okay if you ship hye yeong and Jojo...I do too because by personality they are same. Simply meant to be together.<br>Sunho have yuki...she is better for him. I bet she is brave too to continue to support him even in his worst times. <br>But I love song Kang and Sohyun&#39;s chemistry so...I want them to be in another drama without any love traingle.
