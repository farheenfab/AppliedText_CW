<b>spoiler</b> I honestly don&#39;t understand how people are mad? It was the best ending ever!! THANK YOU!! 🥺🥺🥰 It&#39;s like everyone forgot episode 1 of season 1 where legit SunHo went behind his bestfriend&#39;s back to charm his crush! What kind of friend does that?? Hyeyeong was patient, mature and never selfish that&#39;s what real love means and they portrayed it amazingly!🙏🙏
