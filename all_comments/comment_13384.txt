I Haven&#39;t started this show yet, because I feel like the girl lead will not end up with the guy I ship her with (which is the guy who actually likes her the old fashion way with no tech involved). I also feel like I will be royally pi$$ed by the end of the show, so to prevent my blood from boiling I will just wait until the series end and see who she ends up with. ðŸ‘€
