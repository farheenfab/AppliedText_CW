y&#39;all should check the webtoon out to understand why jojo had to do what she did; her choices, her fear/s, her reasons--there is more to this drama than what was presented to us.<br><br>sunoh wasn&#39;t portrayed properly (or just lacking/wasn&#39;t enough) in S2 thats why some people resent jojo for hurting him and not choosing him in the end. Sunoh was more mature and admirable in the webtoon. but hey, didn&#39;t we get that jojo and sunoh&#39;s closure scene? some people seem to act like it didn&#39;t happen and/or just don&#39;t want to accept it :(<br><br>but yeah, i get what you feel--sohyun and kang were an ideal couple so i hope they&#39;d meet again in another project 🤧🙏🏻
