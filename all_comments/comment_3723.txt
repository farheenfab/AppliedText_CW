Its too hard to go through for sun ho. He adore jojo that much. Love in first sight.  Just happened to both of them. I know that hye yeong also feels alone. But jojo just playing with her feelings because she doesn&#39;t have courage to face her own feelings with sun ho. So disappointed about jojo&#39;s character.
