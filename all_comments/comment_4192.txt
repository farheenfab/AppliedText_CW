Omg the comments are full with hatred. Well despite it&#39;s true Jojo owed Sunoh a better explanation, i&#39;m very much satisfied with season 2 ðŸ˜Š the chemistry between jojo and hyeyoung is comfort and free since both having no secret about their past, while with sunoh is flattering but at the same time filled with anxiety. Since timing is also a variable in falling in love (in drama or in real life), sunoh came in at the wrong period, when her condition is at worst and she&#39;s completely covered with her inferiority, but when hyeyoung era you can tell she&#39;s been healing together with him and her situation really helps. This is so much realistic than for instance she mustered up to tell sunoh what happened back then 4 years ago in order to get back with him (since at the very first start, she never has that courage).. so yeah Well done writer-nim and all the production staffs!
