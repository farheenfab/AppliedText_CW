Unpopular opinion: JOJO SHOULD END UP WITH HYE YOUNG JUST LIKE IN THE WEBTOON (THOUGH IT DOESN&#39;T HAVE MUCH OF A CONCLUSION STILL THE LAST EPISODES OF IT IS FOR JOJO AND HYE YOUNG) BUT IT&#39;S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IT WILL FOLLOW THE POPULARITY TRACK MEANING THERE&#39;S A HIGH CHANCE THAT JOJO AND SUNHO WILL END UP TOGETHER WHICH SUCKS. NETFLIX REMOVED A LOT OF JOJO AND HYEYOUNG SCENES WHILE THEIR SCREEN TIME REVEALED SO MUCH MORE CHEMISTRY THAN SUNHO AND JOJO HAD.
