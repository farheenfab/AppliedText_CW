<b>Okay so I HAVE TO SAY IT because I can&#39;t understand how people can perfer Sunho to Hyeyeong</b><br><br>1/ Hyeyeong fell for Jojo first, and Sunho knew it deep inside but he still kissed Jojo out of the blue and people think that this kiss had a meaning when in real both of Jojo and Sunho weren&#39;t even in love at that time, it felt like they just wanted to forget their problems through this kiss<br><br>2/ Everything was so rushed between Sunho and Jojo like they &quot;were meant to be&quot; when I think that Jojo only had a crush on Sunho because he was there when things got harder for her (she lost her friend, she broke up with her boyfriend and she had even more problems because of her cousin, like Jojo was literally ALONE! And whenever she felt lost or scared, she would go to Sunho because he was the only one who was by her side and she even thanked him for loving her. Jojo was searching for security. Sunho was more like a friend for her than a soulmate<br><br>But then Jojo started feeling insecure with Sunho too because she felt too small with him. <b>The love between Jojo and Sunho was platonic</b> Sunho was also afraid of losing Jojo because no one cared about him except for Hyeyeong, everyone wanted something from him and used him.<br>So both of Jojo and Sunho felt comfortable with each other because they found in each other the thing that they were searching for and they ended up thinking that they were in love, but the thing is that their love wasn&#39;t that deep it was more like a teenage&#39;s crush + Sunho was so immature, and he was so obsessed with Kim Jojo&#39;s visual (always saying that she&#39;s too pretty and too beautiful) when Hyeyeong was seeing more that just that in Jojo<br><br>3/ Hyeyeong literally tried to forget about Kim Jojo for Sunho, he was always supportive with Sunho and respectful with Jojo when she was feeling uncomfortable with him (because she didn&#39;t really know him at first) and the fact that Kim Jojo found Sunho at her hardest times and not Hyeyeong was because she didn&#39;t know Hyeyeong in the beginning, if she met him she maybe wouldn&#39;t have had a crush on Sunho. <br><br>Sunho approached Jojo when Hyeyeong was finally ready to take a step towards her, and after Jojo and Sunho started dating Hyeyeong could do nothing, that&#39;s why Jojo never got to meet him properly, she literally just knew that Hyeyeong was Sunho&#39;s friend and she had a wrong first impression on him because she was uncomfortable knowing that Sunho&#39;s best friend loves her too <br><br>4/ Sunho and Hyeyeong&#39;s personalities are really different, but Hyeyeong was the one who matched the most with Jojo romantically, he was so patient and considerate with her and he always understood her without even having a lot of conversations with her. The fact that he didn&#39;t forget about kim Jojo even after 4 years and he was so respectful with her, he never gave up on her unlike Sunho <br>And Jojo started discovering Hyeyeong who never wanted to rush things with her. At the end Jojo started falling in love with her real soulmate
