I hate the ending. It&#39;s heartbreaking. Why? I can&#39;t understand why can&#39;t Kim Jojo and Sun-Oh end up together? I mean we devoted 80 hours for the first season. And all through the first season, Jojo and Sun-Oh were shown to be perfect for each other and so in love. But after waiting for so long for the second season, the second season was released. I just watched the last episode and the last scene. Surprisingly, Jojo ends up with Hye-Yung and rings his love alarm. I hate it. Hate the series to follow the webtoon&#39;s ending. Simply ridiculous.ðŸ˜¤
