I was so frustrated at this scene , still she didn&#39;t have proper explanation Every word that came out from jojo mouth was so hurting and it can be seen in sunoh&#39;s eyes ...  Hyeyeong hyeyeong hyeyeong , girl you could have just simply explained why you left why you ignored him why are u always running away from him ... But she also knows the fact that she did wrong and she have no excuse for that thats why she always avoids it And now she wanna be happy ??? Have a life ???  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m sad because hyeyeong was the end game BUT with the fact that she keeps running away....
