IT WOULD BE SO STUPID IF SHE DOESNT END UP WITH SUNOH. If I see one more person comment saying to give Hye-Yeong a chance in season 2 I&#39;m going to hit you. She and Hye have zerooooooo connection or chemistry like I don&#39;t see it. Who cares if he liked her first, he was such a coward for not saying anything from the start. and can we all just realize that he was such a stalker, like nahhh i ain&#39;t shipping that. if this show doesn&#39;t end the way I want it to I&#39;m going to sue whoever was involved in the show for emotional distress
