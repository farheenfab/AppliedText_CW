I&#39;ve just realized why i never rly liked Hye Yeong<br>You can&#39;t make someone love you no matter how hard you try or no matter how much you love them <br>And that&#39;s his plan <br>Which is a bit sad in my eyes <br>Everyone complains about her not deciding but both men are free to just leave lmao <br>If they want her then they also gotta handle the indecision
