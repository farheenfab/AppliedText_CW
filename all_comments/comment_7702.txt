I do not understand people. It was Hye-Yeong who deserved the girl. Sun Oh kissed Jo Jo even though he was Hye-Yeong&#39;s close friend and knew he loved Jo Jo. He betrayed his friend and girls find it attractive. Throughout the drama, Hye-Yeong continued to love Jo Jo. He even remained friends with Sun Oh despite what he did. Hye-Yeong is a very kind and valuable person. I am sorry for my English.
