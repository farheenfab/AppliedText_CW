I&#39;m one of the few who&#39;s team hye yeong i know sun oh is more popular, but honestly the fact that he went after jojo even after knowing his best friend likes her and that she already has a boyfriend still doesn&#39;t sit right with me. Their love story is cute in a puppy love kind of way so i hope sun oh&#39;s character become more mature
