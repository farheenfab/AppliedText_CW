I don’t know with everyone. But I really like the idea of Hye Yeong courting Jojo the old school way. How he waited for her and did not pressure her. The part where Jojo was trying to search her heart for what she truly feels and not depend on the love alarm. How Jojo and Hye-yeong’s relationship was super healthy, no drama, just supportive of each other. Jojo made a lot of effort with her relationship with Hye-yeong and vice versa. I didn’t see her care as much with her relationship with Sun-oh. Everything about the two of them was so lovely and nurturing. It warms my heart. ❤️
