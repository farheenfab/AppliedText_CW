Love alarm season 2 broke my heart in episode 3 but still I was hoping that Sun oh and Jojo are meant to be together. Lee is the reason y they both are not together. He knows that she loves Sun oh. Due to his constant involvement and caring nature made jojo fall in love with Lee out of sympathy. Jojo and sun oh looked happy when they were together. They both have some weird love connection which Lee couldn&#39;t provide. It just broke my heart. # my thoughts. According to me, it is always Sun oh and jojo because jojo was completely honest with Sun oh and shared everything without any hesitation. Love you both sun oh and jojo
