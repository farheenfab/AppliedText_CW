Jo Jo broke up with Sun Oh was not because she did not love him. she did. But Jo Jo could not face Sun Oh’s world and its complexities. It was so overwhelming for her. Thus, she decided to break up. In her high school girl mind, “breaking up now is better than later. Breaking up now will hurt less than breaking up later.”<br><br>Well, she was wrong. By breaking up with Sun Oh, she hurted them both and the hurt lingered after years. The-four-years-later-Jo Jo realised this. That’s why she apologised to Sun Oh during their last meeting. <br><br>But then why didnt Jo Jo go back with Sun Oh?<br><br>Well because even four years later, Jo Jo still would not be able to deal with Sun Oh’s world.<br><br>Also, because she loves Hye Yeong now.<br><br>The-four-years-later-Jo Jo at first thought she could not love anyone anymore. But Hye Yeong with his warmth and care changed that. She fell in love with him at the night when she stayed at his house, and the love continues to grow. That’s why when the video of Sun Oh visiting her got viral, all she could think was how hurt Hye Yeong would be. She did not even think about getting back to Sun Oh. Heck, even when Jo Jo visited her school, all she could think was Hye Yeong. She said it herself to Sun Oh. The show also gives us <b>lots</b> of Hye Yeong’s flashback but no Sun Oh’s flashback.<br><br>So actually LA2 is not about Jo Jo choosing between Sun Oh or Hye Yeong but about Jo Jo getting over her trauma and fixing her past mistakes.<br><br>For those who want Sun Oh to be happy, I actually think that Sun Oh is happier with Yuk Jo now. Unlike Jo Jo who could not face Sun Oh’s world, Yuk Jo is mature and loving, and she could handle dining with Sun Oh’s family, seeing their arguments and the truth behind the loving facade, and she still able to maintain positive mindset. That shows how strong Yuk Jo is! Just because she is not the main female lead, it does not mean that she is less than Jo Jo. <br><br>For Sun Oh, I think Yuk Jo is way better than Jo Jo, just the way for Jo Jo, Hye Yeong is better than Sun Oh. So, a perfect ending where everyone is happy!
