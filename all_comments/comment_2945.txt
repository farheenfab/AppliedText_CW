As a viewer, I&#39;m not convinced that Kim doesn&#39;t love sun-oh anymore..i can really feel and see it in her eyes how they long for each other for how many years..and then suddenly, she realized it was the other guy...i don&#39;t know but i feel the pain of sun-oh..it so unfair!!😥😥hopefully there will be a love alarm 3🙏🙏i really love it but is the end that i don&#39;t like!!!
