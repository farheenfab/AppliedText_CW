How could I describe? Sorry to say, but I start to stop watching while episode 4 and skip to the end directly. Their chemistry between Jojo and Sun Oh too much strong in the beginning, so when Jojo and Hye Young together I can&#39;t feel the chemistry as much as strong like between Jojo and Sun Oh. I thought Song Kang should become Hye young and Jung Ga Ram become SunOh. That&#39;s my opinion.<br><br>I hope it will continue to the next season. I heard that the webtoon writer still unfinished the story. So maybe I can see Jojo and SunOh end up together. But if their still doesn&#39;t end up together be better find another character or change songkang with another actor ðŸ˜‚
