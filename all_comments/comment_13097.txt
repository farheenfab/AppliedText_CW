I&#39;m really sad for the people who chooses Sun-Oh for Jojo than Hye yeong. Like it it&#39;s happen in real life they&#39;ll be choosing the person who they like or cuteness than sincerity. I&#39;m not saying that Sun-Oh isn&#39;t sincere to Jojo, but Sun-oh is more like is still not mature when it comes to love. When he knows jojo likes her. He&#39;s not even waiting for her. And he&#39;s manipulative. When it comes to love it&#39;s not just you two like each other. But you also need have respect to each other like how Hye yeong does to Jojo.
