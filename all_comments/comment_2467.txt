<b>*!!SPOILER ALERT!!*</b> <br><br><b>HEY, THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION AND I DON&#39;T WANT TO BE RUDE OR ANYTHING</b> ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’œ<br><br>I am spreading this message because I feel that the character Jojo is getting a lot of hate for no reason. I know that everyone  has their own opinions but aren&#39;t y&#39;all going to far for this, I mean it is just a drama chill ðŸ˜‚<br><br>Firstly, Jojo waited for Sun oh after the accident, he couldn&#39;t show up because of his family of course, but all this<br>time when he wasn&#39;t with Jojo when she was suffering the most and was blaming herself for every single thing that had happened in her life; Hye yeong was with her and helped her get through that situation. Isn&#39;t it natural for her to fall for him even if she wasn&#39;t sure about her feelings it was quite obvious that she liked Hye yeong because he always waited for her and never blamed her for not liking him back since the start.<br><br>When he said &quot;I will keep liking you, even if you don&#39;t like me. So don&#39;t feel pressured or anything...&quot; She felt nothing but love. It&#39;s just that the stupid love alarm didn&#39;t ring because of the shield and that is the main reason CDG decided to drop the plan about releasing Love alarm 2.0, as an app could never really decide whom you truly love it is just your heart.
