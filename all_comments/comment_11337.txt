I STILL HAVE HOPE she will end up with sunoh. I refuse to believe that I waited two years just for him to get heartbroken. Heyyoung is a great guy but deserves better. Team sunoh is bigger!! A lot of ppl are hating on sunoh but he was literally good to her!! She hurt him not the other way around. He deserves an explanation. ALSO i feel like she needs someone to take her out of her comfort zone to reach her potential just like heyyoung, so I dont think they suit each other. Whats the point if she doesnt even know if she likes heyyoung or not? She also told sunoh she would never love someone as much as she loved sunoh, isnt this bad towards heyyoung? Tbh both boys deserve better im over it. Sunoh deserves a caring person who stands by his side and heyyoung deserves someone who will make his shyness go away. Jojo is hurting everyone. PLZZZ TEAM SUNOH ITS NOT FAIR
