why is everyone in this comments section so pressed? I honestly thought this drama was a refreshing break from all those stereotypical ones I&#39;ve watched so far, the character development is amazing and it was honestly such a great ending, I thought who she ended up with was perfect for her! don&#39;t come at me lmao, just saying a change is nice every once in a while:)
