Why are people literally hating on Hye-yeong for simply existing? He didn&#39;t even do anything??? Plus he has the right to go after Jojo&#39;s heart too since she isn&#39;t with Sun-Oh. She ends up with Hye-Yeong in the comic and although the show may end differently, either way don&#39;t hate on either of them. Season ain&#39;t even out yet and y&#39;all are already pressed:/ it&#39;s okay to be team Sun-Oh, but leave Hye-Yeong and team Hye-Yeong alone lmao
