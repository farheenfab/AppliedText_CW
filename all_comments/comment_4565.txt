I&#39;m quite disappointed with the ending as was looking forward that Sun Oh  will end up with Jojo. Although she made a choice to be with Hye - Yong using the spear. Hye - Yong knows she is still in love with Sun-o.She just can&#39;t make up her mind she got so many issues.I like Hye - Yong as well but in Season 1, I just love Kim Jojo and Sun-Oh chemistry.
