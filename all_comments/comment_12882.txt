I watched season one of love alarm right when it was released and my thoughts on sun-oh were that he was cute and v attractive and all, but didn’t compare to hye-yeong at all (no hate to him of course, just i prefer hye-yeong). Unlike sun-oh, I completely fell in love with hye-yeong and his personality as soon as he was introduced. He was so gentle?? So calm, regal, and charming in that sort of sense. As time passed, he grew much more attractive than sun-oh. Despite that, I’m not sure if jojo is actually gonna end up with him. As much we all love the second leads, we know that the main lead have more chances to end up with the girl. But in this teaser, it sort of feels like she actually starts to lean more towards hye-yeong?? We can only dream here for now...
