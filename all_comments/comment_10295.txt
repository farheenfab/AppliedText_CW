this is based off the comic, and the comic has her end up with Hye-young. BUT I AM STILL HOPING AND PRAYING FOR HER TO CHOOSE SUN-OH. That man stole my heart and broke it in season 1 with how much love he showed Jojo. Hye-young is nice and sweet and all, but it really was an instant and passionate connection with Sun-Oh. No slow-burn romance with Hye-young is gonna top that, regardless of how long he waits
