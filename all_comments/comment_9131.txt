At least she recognize that she&#39;s hurting them and that this is not only about her heart, but also Sun Oh&#39;s and Hye Yeong&#39;s. <br><br>I really think that Hye Yeong has a lot of hope and he knows that Jojo&#39;s heart already belong to Sun Oh and he&#39;s lying to himself telling that she will love him someday, but he knows that is not going to happen (at least not in a near future) <br><br>And I do believe that Sun Oh is really desperate bc he doesn&#39;t know what he did wrong and he&#39;s confuse bc he loves Jojo but he doesn&#39;t want to pass through the same and also doesn&#39;t want to hurt anyone else or himself.<br><br>And Jojo is more confuse bc she knows that she love Sun Oh but she want to have feeling for Hye Yeong bc she doesn&#39;t want to hurt him, but she&#39;s realizing that she is just hurting them both more and she&#39;s desperate bc that is driving her crazy and also it&#39;s hurting her, that&#39;s why she needs to know who she really loves, cause she want&#39;s to stop hurting people.
