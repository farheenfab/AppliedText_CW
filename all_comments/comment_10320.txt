This has a Hollywood feel on it.<br><br>The background music, the angle of the camera and the cut scenes. It is like Dawson Creek in the 90s and other teenage US Drama.<br><br>Nice one Netflix. Nice one Love Alarm Casts.<br><br>I am rooting for Jung Ga-Ram sshi&#39;s character. Sincere emotions but too painful to swallow.<br><br>Well, aside from the fact that I like him as a person. Hahaha.
