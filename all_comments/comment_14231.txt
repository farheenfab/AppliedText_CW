Before even watching we are assuming jojo and sunoh&#39;s chemistry will be better. Let&#39;s just watch the show first. After what he did for jojo even if she chose hye yeong, I don&#39;t see any problem here. And Love is not only about chemistry, it&#39;s more about compatibility and I think jojo and hye yeong has more compatibility than jojo and sun oh. For me I think Sun oh kinda selfish type of guy.
