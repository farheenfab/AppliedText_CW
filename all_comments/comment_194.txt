One of the most beautiful and saddest dramas I&#39;ve ever seen.  Adolescent loneliness is told in all its forms.  The 3 protagonists are the loneliest of all.  Alone and unable to communicate with each other.  <br>The female lead is the most immature of all.  I hated her character so much.  She is eternally insecure, without character and personality.<br>Jojo and Sunho belonged to two too different worlds.  They had nothing in common.  They weren&#39;t meant to be together.  This is the truth.<br>Do you really think Sunho&#39;s parents would have accepted a girl like Jojo? Absolutely NOT!
