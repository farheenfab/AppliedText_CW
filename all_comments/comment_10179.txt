Hye young has truly loved Jojo from the beginning. Sun oh only went after Jojo because Hye young was in love with her. Also Hye young is the first person to ring Jojo&#39;s love alarm but Jojo believe it is Sun oh and that&#39;s why she fell in love with him specially after that kiss in the alley. And at the end I am sure she will end up with Sun oh. But I wish it was with Hye young ðŸ˜¢ðŸ’”
