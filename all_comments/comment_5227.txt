I don&#39;t know all the comments are talking about how they are disappointed with the season 2 but you know guys i find you all wrong because relationship isn&#39;t just about looking good together and i actually felt like seasons 2 was worth watching because hye yeong deserved better and he got better and i think sun oh was also better off with yuk jo she really liked him and deep down he too did...
