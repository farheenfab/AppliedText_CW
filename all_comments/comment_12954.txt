for the past 1 year, we waited for her reply ( as long as sun oh and hye young waited for her ) if she doesn&#39;t end up with sun oh after all my patience and pride, I&#39;m gonna leave it all behind and give a visit to Korea and the writer in person.<br>[ it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t like hye young or him ending up with jojo , it&#39;s just not pleasing to me seeing that sun oh didn&#39;t do anything wrong like I know that people say he wasn&#39;t by her side but she broke him first, it&#39;s just not fair, as much as hye young waited and I know his heart will break so did sun oh&#39;s too she break up with him and he&#39;s still like her, both of them love her but after breaking heart sun ho it still in love with(don&#39;t say that hye young heart also broke because of she was with sun oh, but he denied her feelings and didn&#39;t confess to her just like sun oh did, so that breaking of heart by jojo but he was breaking his heart by himself, its true love. please jojo don&#39;t be dumb like any other female leads you know where your heart belongs as do we (because we are the viewers we see everything like a god).
