People say sunoh wasn&#39;t good coz he knew his friend liked her and still went for her BUT now i saw it again and he actually asked him many times nd his asnwer was always no and you can&#39;t control your heart...sunoh didn&#39;t waste his time, he made her to notice him unlike his friend who just stood there instead of taking a step towards jojo.. So jojo noticed sun oh and fell in love with him and picked him.. It&#39;s all about timing.. i hope they get together in season 2
