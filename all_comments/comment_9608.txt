i Couldn’t understand why all the people like sun oh is it because of he’s way more handsome than hyeyeong??? If they put themselves in hye yeong’s will they still like sun oh ..He kissed jojo when he knew that his bestfriend loves her ..Hye yeong truly loved jojo from the beginning ..Sunoh only went after jojo because his bestfriend was in love with her also hye yeong was the first person to ring jojos love alarm and she thinks thhat it was sun oh and thats why she fell in love with him ...it isnt fair for hye yeonggg!!
