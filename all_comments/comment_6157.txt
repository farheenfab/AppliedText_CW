I read the webtoon which made me sad but I think Hye yeong is good for Jojo but at the same time I think Jojo still has feelings for Sun Oh and I think she should follow what her heart says but there are feelings that will get hurt including mine I like hye yeon for Jojo because he was there for her when no one else was but the reason I also want sun oh to end up with Jojo because they still love each other but Jojo is to scared to admit it because she is afraid that she will hurt sun oh and hye yeon but we cant avoid the fact that there will be feelings that will get hurt in the end.<br><br>Ps: I did not read the whole story I only read the ending:)) i rlly want Jojo to end up with sun oh tho
