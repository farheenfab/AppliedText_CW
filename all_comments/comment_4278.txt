To the one who wrote this story. Thank you for making this masterpiece! Thank you for writing and trusting the right ending of this story. I really thought that it will end in a cliche way but omg thank you for being unpredictable! Thank you for making this story unique. Some stories out there changed because of ratings, production company, and viewers. And for me that&#39;s really disrespectful of what the writer really wants. How he/she wants to end it. I&#39;m so happy that the writer of this story has the freedom to tell the whole story. That&#39;s what makes this art an ART. Thank you!
