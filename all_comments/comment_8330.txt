This love triangle has a similarity to the manga, Bokura ga Ita. Nana (the main girl) also tried liking Takeuchi (second lead boy) when Yano (the main lead boy) left Nana&#39;s side during their adulthood. And in the end, Nana still chose Yano over Takeuchi. Maybe this kdrama will also have the same ending.
