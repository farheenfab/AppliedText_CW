Am I the only one actually hoping she ends up alone in the end? I want Hyeyeoung to find someone better, Jojo doesn’t deserve him. And she hurt Sunoh when she broke up with him. I just want her to find herself and love herself more than these guys in the end because I don’t think she truly deserves either of them, especially to have them dragging on their love for her for this long and she still can’t make up her mind.
