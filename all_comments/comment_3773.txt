Sun oh deserved to be happy. Many are saying that hye yeong’s feelings were constant,he didn’t date anyone but waited. The truth is he didn’t get any whereas sun ho had many all around him, who had crush on him still he liked Jojo who dumped every guy whenever she felt like first ilsik then sun oh. So I would say sun ho’s love,feelings were more persistent that among many he chooses Jojo again and again who dumps people for no reason
