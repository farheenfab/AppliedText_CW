I love the fact that Jojo and Hye ended up together. From the start, Sun-oh only found out about Jojo because he was following Hye. Hye was Sun&#39;s best friend since childhood and knowing that Hye liked her, he still decided to pursue her. That&#39;s the epitome of a crappy friend and shows that he always felt superior to Hye. Forcing Jojo to kiss him was also a shitty thing to do and what Season 2 shows us, which was present, but less obvious in Season 1, Sun wants what he wants and never took the time to understand Jojo, or show any consideration for Hye&#39;s feelings. Hye had been genuine from Day one and was patient with Jojo, he was honest with his feelings and someone she could relate to and depend on. Sun&#39;s relationship with Yuk-Jo was exactly what he needed, this felt more like falling in love with someone, while with Jojo, it felt more like an obsession or fixation.
