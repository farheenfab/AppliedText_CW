Is it just me or does anyone thinks that this might be a scene where Jojo rings Hye Yeongs love alarm at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=50">0:50</a> Cuz look at them both smiling, and that tears of joy in Hye Yeongs eyes. And when he was about to hug Jojo, it looks like she is going to hug him back like her hand movement. <br>Like they both look so happy.<br>(Just my theory. No hate.<br>I just want happy ending for everyone)
