I guess many people don&#39;t get the essence of the story and why Jojo ended up with Hyeyeong, it was interesting to read comments explaining it though. Anyways, we all have our own ship and point of views, but I&#39;m very much contented with Hyeyeong and Jojo finally having their happy ending. Also, the cinematography in Love Alarm is amazing 💯👏
