I actually liked the ending? Why is everyone so butthurt? Are you hating on it just because the pretty guy didnt get the girl? Yes Sun Oh was betrayed because Jojo lied and I hate her reasoning for installing the shield BUT she did, it was her decision and the story should continue based on it. Season 2 was the continuation of Jojo&#39;s decision and the ending made sense. She made space for Hyeyeong&#39;s affection and let&#39;s be real, he&#39;s a great guy so it would only take time to make Jojo his. Soon Jojo also lost attraction towards Sun Oh, it&#39;s just natural to get over someone when you start liking someone else.
