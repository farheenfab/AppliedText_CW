I wish jojo choose someone who can make her happy and dont feel small. Someone she can be comfortable to and always be honest to herself. I hope hyeyoung would finally be able to find love and live with someone who love and appreciate him. I hope that sunoh will finally realise that he is being loved and he is not alone and that there will always be his friends who accept him and love him and would go through anything to help him. I just wish they all could be happy. Idm if jojo end up with hyeyoung or sunoh.
