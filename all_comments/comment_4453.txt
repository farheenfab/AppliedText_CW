SHUT THE HELL UP!!!!! I love sun-oh and I wanted him to be end game however something happened during season 2 and I started rooting for hye-young. All I hear are people complaining but I thought the ending was one of the most beautiful scenes i have ever witnessed. As revealed JoJo genuinely rung hye-young&#39;s love alarm multiple times. Also didn&#39;t anyone else get MIND-BLOWN when it was explained Kim JoJo will be removed from hye-young&#39;s app where it predicts she will like him? IT DISAPPEARED BECAUSE SHE LIKES HIM AND IT HAPPENED THE MOMENT SUN-OH KISSED HER!!!!!!!!!!!!! All she could think about was hye-young. Which is opposite to what everyone assumes watching this trailer!!!!
