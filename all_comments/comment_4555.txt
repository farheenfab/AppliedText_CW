I feel like I’m the only one who’s satisfied with the ending, I don’t like sun oh. Yes he’s had a bad upbringing but that does not excuse the fact that he IS toxic, and I noticed it a lot in this season. His behavior in some scenes I just down right scary, hye yeong was so patient, kind, and loving towards Jojo which is what she needs to help herself heal as well.<br><br>Most of the sun oh shippers only ship the because he is hot and completely ignore his toxic behaviors.
