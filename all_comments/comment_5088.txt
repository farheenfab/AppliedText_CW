Honestly in my opinion I really like the ending, I know that’s it’s a web toon but it’s a great ending. Because  if you think about I can understand why jojo was so unsure about her feelings in the beginning &amp; when she around Hye-yeong I could feel there connection, and how he made her feel. So overall, I was already crying in the beginning of Season 2 LMAO it was an emotional roller coaster.
