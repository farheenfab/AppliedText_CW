i know that jojo is actually really confused back then and choose a quick alternative (reset love alarm) because she thought if she reset it,it wont hurt her self or sun-oh but yaa she&#39;s ended up hurting herself and sunoh at the same time :(  and if they dont end together i hope that at least jojo tell sunoh the reason why her alarm isn&#39;t ringing,why she&#39;s decided to reset her alarm,and tell that she&#39;s actually love sunoh so much :( because if jojo didn&#39;t tell him,he&#39;s actually will never know the actual reasons and blame him self for what happened:(  i just want they&#39;re happy, because they&#39;ve been hurt their self for a long long time :(
