The character Song Kang plays is quite sad. Yea, he was pretty inconsiderate and forceful towards Jojo in season 2. I never really liked how they came to be a couple in season 1 (the kiss while she was dating another, him knowing his friend likes her but still pursues) but their chemistry was cute. Just sad because he never knew why Jojo all of a sudden dropped him without an explanation. All because she thought she was doing him a favor— for the sake of his future based on what his rich parents wanted. Then his friend goes on to make a move on her years after. Why they gotta do a story about besties liking the same girl 😭 Sure, he liked her first but his azz never made a move til later after his friend’s relationship with her fails!? And knowing what his friend went through!? Then the girl falls for the friend. 🤦🏻‍♀️ It makes sense that the ending couple was meant to be but how they came to be was irritating. This drama is a dumpster fire.
