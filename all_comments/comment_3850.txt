I am that type of person, if I start a drama I will complete it anyway although its boring.. but Honestly I just drop this after s-1. I feel like: what&#39;s the wrong thing sun-oh did so that he could not end up with her.. Its all because of that scooter accident.. I feel like s-2 is all boring only according to my view.. For those who enjoyed it please dont mind me..&lt;3
