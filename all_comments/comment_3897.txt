It’s not fair for Sunho to be treated by Jojo like that, he deserved an explanation. Sunho had been honest with her since the beginning, shielded her from her mean friends and classmates, fought for her and pursued her relentlessly despite the difference in their economic status. Sunho was willing to fight for their relationship and because of her pride, she dumped him…it’s not fair really. <br>Even if Hyeyeong waited for her and deserves to be happy as well, it doesn’t make sense at all, how can he pursue Jojo knowing that she had hurt his friend big time. And how can Jojo entertain Hyeyeong, give him a chance but not Sunho? Her character is so confusing…my heart just aches for Sunho, I shouldn’t have read the spoilers because if it’s not going to be Sunho and Jojo in the end, I’d rather not watch😢 omg why am I so affected lol✌️
