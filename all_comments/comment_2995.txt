Jojo is the most toxic character i&#39;ve ever encountered in a kdrama. Imagine, hurting someone who really loves you just because of your insecurities? Leaving hin because you don&#39;t wanna hurt him because of you? What a nonsense excuse. Leaving him had already hurt him for 4 years then showing to him that you&#39;ve fallen in love with his bestfriend. If i had known that you would leave him because of a nonsense excuse, I wouldn&#39;t have watched love alarm. How could you do that to sun oh?!
