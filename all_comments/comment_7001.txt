Am I the only one who is also intrested on the concept of having an app like Love Alarm? Like imagine having an app that shows you if there is someone in your area that is in love with you in real life, people would get obsessed over it, flex about it and let it take control over their lifes like in the series. I am also curious about the main characters, are they going to listen to the app or their real feelings?
