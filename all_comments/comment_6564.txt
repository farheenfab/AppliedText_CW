Jojo hurt both of them, so badly. If only she is being truthful to Sunoh, justified the breakup with reasonable cause, not just too sudden and being selfish, Sunoh probably could move on long time ago already. The reason why Sunoh being clingy and kept lingering around her is because he cannot understand and is not convinced enough that there is no more spark btween them.<br>Jojo also gave false hopes to Hyeyoung. She herself did not had a proper breakup with Sunoh and even get close to Hyeyoung. Hyeyoung and Sunoh were bestfriends for god&#39;s sake! <br>Oh my, this really boiled up my blood real quick.
