I think it&#39;s kind of unfair with what jojo did to Sun oh.... She tried to love hye yong and ditched sunoh thinking that her past would hurt him...it seems like she doesn&#39;t care whether hyeyong would be hurt by her past or not...for me it will be the worst drama if she doesn&#39;t end up with sun oh...I don&#39;t care about how the webtoon ended I just want them to be together because it looks unfair...
