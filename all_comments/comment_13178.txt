Woah! Woah! Woah! I still don&#39;t get whats going to happen. But I am still watching. Why? Because we love seeing our second leads heart shatter into pieces because of the main lead. But atleast she knows that the 2nd lead loves her.<br>Proud of you JOJ. Hwaiting ~~<br><br>I want to say to Jojo that girl it&#39;s not that you don&#39;t know who do you like it&#39;s just that you can&#39;t let go of one to have another. I know I truly understand you. For some reason I want HAN SEO JUN and LEE SUHO to give some classes to Hye hyeong and Sun oh. üòÇ Y&#39;all need to learn from my baby HAN SEO JUN. üòé<br>Stop pressuring the main leads to love you the 2nd leads  back it&#39;s never going to happen. It&#39;s always the main leads END GAME. <br><br>And y&#39;all you know what I just watched the S1 a week ago. I did not watch it when it was released back then because I saw I alot of my friends were going through alot while watching S1. So... I just wanted to FLEX that I only waited for a week for S2.<br><br>All the best... I love you all three. Jojo, Sun oh and Hye hyeong. üòç
