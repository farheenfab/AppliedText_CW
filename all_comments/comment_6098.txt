I know that hye-yong is the best choice for jojo but... i feel as if jojo is kind of forcing her feelings for hye-yong, while she loves Sun-Oh. Honestly... I dont care who she chooses but I hope that atleast none of them get hurt. I didn&#39;t wait two years for her end the trailer saying &quot;tell me who I like?&quot; No one NEEDS a season 3, we want this done once and for all. I hope Jojo chooses the person she truly loves and not follow the stupid app. And just so you know: I am team Sun-Oh but who knows? I like Hye-yong too.
