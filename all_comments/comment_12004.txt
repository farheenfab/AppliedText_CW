Y&#39;all be hating Jojo about not knowing who she likes between the two but she really had a hard time. She doesn&#39;t have someone who loves her and to be added, who can choose only one with those two handsome boys?  I mean, sizt it&#39;s fcking hard. But if you still pushing her like that, I will really like this drama to end with both the male leads in love together. Jojo can love herself lol.
