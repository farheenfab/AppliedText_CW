Am not been a heater, but I just wanna be realistic. How can he kiss a girl that he clearly knew that his best friend has a feeling for that is just ridiculous, unfair, and unfaithful to me. There is a &quot;NO DO&quot; list in life and this one of them. What really pissed me off about his character is that he feel unapologetic towards things he does. For example sorry for the SPOILERðŸ˜” when he kissed the girl, he has the audacity city to told his best friend that he kissed the girl that he knows that HIS BEST FRIEND REALLY LIKES THE GIRL!!!!! I was so pissed up to the extent that made me yelled at my goddamn tv when he said that to his face.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23loyality">#loyality</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23badfriend">#Badfriend</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23unfair">#unfair</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23disrespectful">#disrespectful</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23unapologetic">#unapologetic</a>
