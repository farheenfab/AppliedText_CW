I didn&#39;t finished watching season 2. Not because I hated that Sun-oh wasn&#39;t the one Jojo chose. In season 1 i really like sun-oh but when i watch season 2 i felt like hye-yeong also deserves to be love. But season 2 got me really boring. It&#39;s like every episode I&#39;m like just waiting for it to end. It got me really boring unlike season 1. I stopped watching half of the ep 5 and fast forward it to ending.
