First kissing scene in the first episode doesn&#39;t even come close to the kiss in the last episode of the series and what a major joke. <br>What a pity they chose to let go of this tension, chemistry and heart-fluttering romance for the sake of playing by the book and ending up with mellow, boring and non-sensical plotlines.
