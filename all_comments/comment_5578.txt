I know I probably shouldn&#39;t have done this and it&#39;s just spoiling it for me but I couldn&#39;t wait, I have waited so long for this I just wanna frickin know who she chooses, so I went to the very last second of the end and holy shit I&#39;m crying, but you&#39;ll have to find out if I&#39;m happy crying or sad crying.<br>(Btw I want sunho and jojo together)
