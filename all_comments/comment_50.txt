I still don&#39;t get why she ended up with the other guy .Like sun ho loved her from beginning to end and she broke up with him for her selfish reason yet she still loved him and he still loved her Very much. Then Sun ho&#39;s his friend comes in the picture all of a sudden in s2 and just a few following her around and she is in love with him. So called HAPPY ENDING, it would have been better if she ended up alone if they we&#39;re planning that.
