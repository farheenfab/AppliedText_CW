Gosh I got a bad feeling about this srrly lol<br>I want Jojo to end up with Sunoh continue story of S.1 but then seeing ppl say she will end up with other guy like in webtoon and how the trailer set off...make me don&#39;t wanna watch it haha<br>Literally seeing ppl say Sunoh is toxic.. I wonder how is he toxic? <br>Jojo is hurting both of them cus her confused feelings, she didn&#39;t open up and breaking up reason was kinda unreasonable. Not really fair to Sunoh too
