it&#39;s so obvious jojo is gonna end up with hye-young.. i hate it. i did not wait 2 years for this. in the webtoon she ends up with hye-young, but I thought there was a chance they would change the story because of the high demand for her to end up with sunoh. she doesnt love hye-young. she feels bad for him. sunoh was always sweet and never did anything wrong which is why hes upset. idk if yall saw the pictures that were posted on instagram of all the main characters and a quote, but jojos quote said &quot;for the first time I told him I liked him&quot;, implying that she told HYE YOUNG because shes already told sunoh. im going to be so so so upset when they end up together. i really wish they changed the storyline. sunoh deserves way better than jojo but I still want him to end up with her because he loves her. this is the worst case 2nd lead ship ive ever had. i remember when people would complain that 2nd leads dont get enough screen time.. well guess what? we got the 2nd lead to have lots of screen time in season 1, and what did that lead to? us getting our hearts broken T-T. its obvious how this is going to go. shes gonna force herself to stop wanting sunoh, and then force herself to have feelings for hye young out of pity. im team sunoh and no one can change my mind. this couldve been one of the best kdramas out there but after she ends up with hye young this show is gonna ruined. I really wish i wouldve been able to come back to this comment after the season is released and say &quot;i was wrong! she ended up with sunoh!!&quot; but sadly i cant do that ;-; long rant lol
