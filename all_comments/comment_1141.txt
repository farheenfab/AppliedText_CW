Kim Jojo and Sun are very close to each other, like two halves of an apple, I think they are very warm and love story sweet with each other. They should never leave each other, please don&#39;t ever separate them. Already in the last two or three episodes my heart was hurt enough please please let them be with each other. I just want something to be so simple that their love goes on, otherwise I&#39;m going to be frustrated for the series. My so so sory😢🙏🙏🙏
