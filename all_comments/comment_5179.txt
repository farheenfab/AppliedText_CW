So this is just too crazy, a mean when I started watching this last year I was so amazed. I loved this movie and when I love a movie I will watch it a thousand times. But no this remined me of vampire dairies I WILL NEVER FINISH WATCHING VAMPIRE DAIRIES never the thing is I finished this one having my hopes up, straight up to the last two seconds because we all know k-drama they will make you feel like &quot; oh hell no&quot; in the last 30 seconds but leave you with a &quot; yesssssssssssssssssss ........... like what the hell they had to&quot;  in the last 5 but this broke my heart, I am pissed you expect me to watch this again it&#39;s not possible it&#39;s just not. Its a pretty good movie to be honest, love the characters but I will never watch it again. I just hate this season and it&#39;s making me hate the entire movie after getting my hopes up the ending is just a load of bull. PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
