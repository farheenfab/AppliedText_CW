Hye Yeong during high school days, was late in confessing to Jojo. <br>Haters: He&#39;s a coward, he was asked many times if he liked her, he deserves Jojo not liking him and deciding to be with Sun Oh.<br><br>Hye Yeong during adult years: Confesses to Jojo and helps in her healing process. <br>Haters: He&#39;s a bad person, he shouldn&#39;t date his best friends ex, he should be there for Sun Oh, Jojo broke Sun Oh&#39;s heart. He doesn&#39;t deserve to end up with Jojo cause Sun Oh still loves her.<br><br>Me: WTF do you want from this man? What do you want him to do? Is it wrong to put himself first? Y&#39;all act like he&#39;s a murderer..smh.
