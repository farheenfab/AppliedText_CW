Even if I&#39;m super sad for Sun-oh Hye-young really deserves Jojo and you know what Sun-oh and Jojo had is in the past it&#39;s something both of them can look back on and remember the good ol days where they were in love it&#39;s a great memory they both shared and maybe Sun-oh will never get over Jojo but I don&#39;t feel like anybody get over a love like that and plus Yukjo really deserves Sun-oh so yeah at first I was really disappointed with this ending but it is what it is
