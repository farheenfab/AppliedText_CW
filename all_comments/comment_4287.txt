yesss,, i finished s2 and ive seen that most people are disappointed with the ending (but let&#39;s keep that as a secret for those who haven&#39;t watched it, please? ok!) i don&#39;t see how it was disappointing?? i mean i know that jojo seemed really annoying, selfish, whatever you even want to badly describe her character, but the fact that she found herself after years of being confused with her feelings and life was nice to witness because it&#39;s really a life-lesson at most points ðŸ˜¸<br><br>sun-oh&#39;s actions in s2 was reasonable too, he was locked away from the world, out of contact with jojo, never rlly got that much attention from his family and he only had hey-yeong in s1 and that fell off at someppoint too. poor babi (&gt;_&lt;). i thought he deserved way better than jojo. they were just hurting each other which wasn&#39;t good for the both of them. <br><br>there was just one action in s2, that sun-oh did which was pressuring somebody and touching(especially kissing) them without their permission did not just sit right with me, especially knowing that she was somebody&#39;s gf (well that&#39;s what he knew as the character). no matter how much lovey dovey you have from the past shouldn&#39;t give you an excuse to do so, am i right? let&#39;s educate ourself about respecting other people&#39;s personal bubble.<br><br>the ending is reasonable enough if you actually based it on the character&#39;s actions/emotions/realizations during that time and well, not on their looks or the past.<br><br>hey, atleast sun-oh still had a happy ending. atleast. im rlly happy with all the character&#39;s ending, honestly, bc they moved on from the past, went on with life instead of meddling with it and hurting each other / themselves more.
