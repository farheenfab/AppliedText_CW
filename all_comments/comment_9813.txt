At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Oj4A2rslY&amp;t=50">0:50</a> part, where Hye-yeong hugs Jojo there could be two situations that possibly happened there, One is Jojo finally decided to ring his alarm since he is holding his phone and he is happy that she finally liked him, or Two is that even after all the times she had spent with him she tells him that she still likes SunOh and he hugged her because he wanted to show her that he wanted her to be happy even when he was not the one she likes.  It is  also possible that she may not pick either of the two but meh. I seriously don&#39;t root for either SunOh or Hyeyeong to end up with Jojo because its too much for my heart to handle ;-;..<br><br>EDIT: I am also feeling that It would be Hyeyeong as Endgame because on Jojo&#39;s poster it says &quot;I tell him for the first time that I like him&quot; and If I remember correctly during Season 1, Jojo had already told SunOh that she likes him before they had broken up so If it were SunOh wouldn&#39;t it&#39;d be the second time?
