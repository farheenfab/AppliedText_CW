There's this one little shop in our city that primarily sells kids' toys, plushies, books - comics, encyclopedias, and much more while following the most recent trends. When I noticed it at first it was the era of Fortnite, second, it was little red plushies from the Squid game and now the shop's front window is still occupied by little plushies of that blue monster from the Poppy playtime gamelove it
