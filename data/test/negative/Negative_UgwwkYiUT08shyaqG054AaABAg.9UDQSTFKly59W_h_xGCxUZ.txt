At first he was relatable but he went too far at the end. 
Spoiler:

Betraying your "lil bro"? Killing a girl who was minutes away from dying anyway? K that sucks, but its a game with only 1 winner, so I can get that. But killing yourself before you can win/split the money??? Huh??? So everything else was pointless? Imo suicide wasnt realistic/relatable for his character at all.
