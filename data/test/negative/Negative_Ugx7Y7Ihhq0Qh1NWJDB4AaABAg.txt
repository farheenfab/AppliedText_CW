From watching him being an adorable fool in Prison playbook, a cold and brutal killer in Time to hunt to watching him being a pity antagonist in Squid game, just imagine the amount of brain damage Park Hae Soo caused me  he’s such a good actor. I can’t wait to see his version of Money Heist’s Berlin. Btw his personality is so cute, just like in the Game Caterers x BH Ent
