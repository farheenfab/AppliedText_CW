I really liked this series

i mean, the plot is very common, like escape room, would you rather, alice in borderland and SAW and other multiple death game-like movies and series, but this one stands out to me the most is because the diffrence of this series from all the other death game movies/series i just mentioned is that they were literally given the chance and the decision to leave the game alive, like in other movies whenever they want to leave, they die/get killed, but in Squid Game, they were given the choice to leave and even stop playing the game, they just have to vote, and they did, but they realized that the real world is so much worse and so some of them (i think) returned to the game, and the ending was rlly cool, and i cant wait for season 2
