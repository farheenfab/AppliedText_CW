I got another game idea.Monkey barS.The players will be going through a door to a really cold room.The bars will be about 50-100ft in the air and you will have to climb it which is like 15ft away.If you fall,you will fall in a icy place where you will be stuck there with no way out as you freeze to death.The players that has fallen will remain in the freezing area for their entirnity.
