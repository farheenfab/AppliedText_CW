If they allow woman to be the pink soldier, I wish Jennie Blackpink could be one of the soldier.

Also, Ali's wife ... It'll shocking to see if the season 2 start with Ali's wife scene: She's struggle financially with the disappearance of her husband. Then later she give her son into some orphanage, and then Gong Yoo will ask her to play, then she pick the red card.

I think if season 2 started with Ali's wife scene, viewers will be shock & tears will be dropped since the 1st 10 minutes.
