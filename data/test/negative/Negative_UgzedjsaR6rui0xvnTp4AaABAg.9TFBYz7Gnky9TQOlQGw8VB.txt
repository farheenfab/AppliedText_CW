@@NaughtsThoughts not what he meant. In one scene a character who is wrongfully upset gets beaten to death with no mercy. Without seeing the blood or anything it has no value to the scene because it just looks like he got punched. Its like if you cut out all the fish from Finding Nemo. It would remove what the show is about.
