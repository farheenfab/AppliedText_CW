@@craycrayinagoodway8228you're missing an important part. They DIDN'T KNOW that they were playing a game of life or death. They just thought that being eliminated meant you would go back home, not being killed. If they knew beforehand, then yes. I would understand. But because it was such a shocking reveal, it would definitely cause the panic you saw.
I don't believe for even a second that you would just be able to think, "oh, I have to stand still or I'll die." No way in hell.
