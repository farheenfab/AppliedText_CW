@@egoxagony4623 “there are no genes influencing greed” so are other emotions as well, why love? Oh right, a chemical reaction to continue the human species, why anger? why anxiety? why are human so afraid of being outcasted and cares so much about what others think about them? Right, bc for our primitive ancestors, being outcasted/rejected by the tribe means death since you most likely won’t survive on your own, without greed humans won’t gather extra food, what happens if some unknown disaster strikes, that enable them to hunt for more food? Right, death through starvation, can’t survive winter etc.  greed is innate, no one taught you “How To Develop the Emotion of Greed 101 Class for Dummies” even an innocent kid unknown to the world knows what greed feels like and can be greedy, I mean unless you have some sort of mental delay problem then that can’t be said
