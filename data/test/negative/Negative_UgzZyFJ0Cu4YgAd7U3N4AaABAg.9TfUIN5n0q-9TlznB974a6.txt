Loved the tug-of-war, but there was something a little unreal about it. The girl got hit by a big piece of glass, though when shot, the glass should have fallen down. And being tempered glass, it should have shattered into tiny pieces, since that is what tempered glass does on car windows. How she got hit by that piece of glass is a good guess as she turned her back to the shattered glass, yet she was hit in her belly. The editors should have caught that and had her not turn as quickly so the glass could have injured her. I know, I'm picky but I have been tearing apart The Blacklist for clues to Raymond Reddington's identity. That's when you see boo boos.
