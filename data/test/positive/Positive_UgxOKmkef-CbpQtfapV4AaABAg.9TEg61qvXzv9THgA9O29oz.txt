@violet As the Director of the Blobfish Games, I have to inform you that you have violated our agreement by sharing company Informationen and revealing the Grand Price that awaits the Lucky Winner to the Public. 

You signed a contract when you applied as a Triangle in the Blobfish Games, but since you violated our agreement, we must inform you that we have to terminate your Position as Triangle and instead made you a Player in the next Upcoming Games. Congratulations   
We will get you as soon as the next Game starts. We have the Adress.
