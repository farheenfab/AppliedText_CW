The entire cast is so cute and full of good vibes. Also, Deok-Su’s actor Plays villain roles so well but irl he seems so sweet and soft spoken. That just goes to show how good of an actor he is. And Sae-Byeok’s actress is amazing as well. This is her acting debut and she really pulled on my heart strings with her acting. She made me cry. I NEVER cry
