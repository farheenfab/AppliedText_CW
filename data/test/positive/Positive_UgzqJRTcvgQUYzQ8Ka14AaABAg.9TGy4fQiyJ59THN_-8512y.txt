I have this weird theory that In Ho purposely shot Jun Ho in the shoulders so he wouldn't be gravely wounded. Then he pulled him out of the waters and brought him safely to the ground or his lair, and medicate him. In Ho will move up as one of the VIPs, and Jun Ho will take his place as the Front Man.
Jun Ho will be torn between his morals and his sworn duty as a police officer, and his love for his brother. And maybe, the reason why In Ho's doing what he's doing is because of Jun Ho.
Season 2 will be about taking down the "Squid Game" syndicate with the help of the videos sent by Jun Ho to the police, and the police will partner with Gi Hun since he had been there and went out as the sole survivor.
New players will be sent in (but they're police assets), but over time, each one of them will be corrupted by money and greed, and the original plan will be compromised.
