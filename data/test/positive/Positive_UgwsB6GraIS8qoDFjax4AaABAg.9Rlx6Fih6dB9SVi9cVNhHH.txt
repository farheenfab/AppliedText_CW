@@tanaykmr movie felt rush. This series exhausted every possibilities, including characters building and their person game of death.

The north Korea girls and the old man with his friends playing marbles on the game of death was the best scene. A real jerker. They didn't rush like the rest, but took their time to enjoy till their last minutes.

The old man should have won, but he put on a nice act on being dementia and gave his friend the chance to make a comeback.
He even revealed it at the end that the friend try to cheat him.

The moral of the story for me after watching this.. don't be wasteful and greedy.

Just be happy on what you have.

I feel like a lot of them don't have to die.
