There's just something about Korean shows and films that really hits me hard. This one wasn't any different. I know that the theme isn't exactly new, but the execution is just perfect. It's not overrated at all, people talk about it because it's a masterpiece. It deserves all the attention. (Also I can't believe that this show made me laugh so much during a scene where a lot of people were dying. Hint: licking)
