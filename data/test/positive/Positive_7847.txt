Just finished. I’m truly amazed. The message is clear:
1. There is a find line between evil and good, and the choice is truly yours no matter how intense a situation can be 

2. You have the ability to bring good and humanity in someone by being caring and selfless 

3. Money is never worth someone’s life. Blood money will bring more chaos and unease 

4. As the old man said, one thing that those affluent and destitute have in common is that lives of both are no fun. 

Ultimately, when you think about it, even if you have all the wealth in world, will you still be satisfied? No. Because no wealth and power will give you answer to everything in this world. It can never give you answer of when you will die and how to escape from death. You’ll always have to spend your money to have some fun when death comes and knocks on your door. Rich or poor, both are temporary with temporary situations.
