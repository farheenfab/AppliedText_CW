This was a really complex, thought provoking and subversive show. I thought it was gonna just be non stop violence but it definitely had a lot to say.

Predatory capitalism, debt as control, materialism not leading to happiness, elite psychology and psychopathy, the journey being more important than the goal, how society treats the elderly...its all those things. Really well made and intelligent, I was blown away by it.
