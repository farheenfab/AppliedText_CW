I think it would be intresting if the reality show is somewhat related to season 2 or at least gives us hints. Like the game has really been going on in more than just one country not just south korea. I checked the website and saw they are casting people from US and UK. They are casting globally too. It would be a nice way to get fans involved and make them feel part of the story.
