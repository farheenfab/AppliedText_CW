The Tug of War was one of the most gripping scenes I have ever seen in my entire life. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and the cliffhanger was absolute perfection. Now I can see the lengths the actors went to get that shot so perfect. Absolutely amazing work Squid Game cast and team. The efforts to make this scene is clear on your faces and you should be proud for making it such an amazing scene.
