I’m old and tired of watching same old stuffs. No movies or series really impressed me until I saw squid game. This is a game changer. I watched entire episodes between 6pm to 3am without breaks and still think about it. What will I do if I’m in same situation? I came into conclusion that I would’ve most likely got shot in first game. I highly recommend this show to everyone.
