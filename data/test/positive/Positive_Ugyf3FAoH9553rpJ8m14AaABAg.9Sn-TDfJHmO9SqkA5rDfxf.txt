 nahh Korean don't seems fluent only few celebrities can speak English. The Squid Game casts are almost who can atleast speak English better than their people. Even in Japan not all can speak English but just like this cast there are celebrities who speaks better English. The difference between Japanese and Koreans are Koreans don't feel shy to speak even if they are poor in English but Japanese they would think 3x before they speak if they're poor in foreign language.
