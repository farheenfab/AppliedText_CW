  i am 18 y/o but i think he is an attractive man. It doesn't matter how old someone is to look fine. It's like saying Brad Pitt was gorgeous till 35 and after 35 he isn't anymore handsome bcs he became old 
Like make the sense.
This man is the same case. He is so goddamn attractive + he almost looks like 30.
