Why is nobody talking about the old man himself who is behind this dalgona trend? He literally worked 12 hours a day to make 15 kgs of dalgona. He's been working for 25 years in this business and now finally getting the recognition he deserves. I'm so happy for him.



*Edit (for those who're misunderstanding) -* I am aware of the fact that dalgona has always been a traditional sweet from before and that several other sellers have been making it for ages. I just intended to say that it was only 'cause of _Squid Game_ that this traditional sweet popularized worldwide, so thanks to that old man for being a part of the contribution by making numerous dalgonas on set and help manifest this popularization.
