I don't care who copies who as long as I get amazing shows. That's like saying Halo copied Doom since it was the first fps game or Naruto and One Piece copied Dragon ball for having similar shonen tropes. It's like sayingTain to Busan copied the first zombie movie. Doesn't make sense. Does it matter that much if the other version did it better than the original lmao?
