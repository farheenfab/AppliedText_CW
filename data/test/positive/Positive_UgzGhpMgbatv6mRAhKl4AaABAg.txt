Most supprising gem on netflix , was enticed by this but tgen watching it , it was far better then i expected , way more deeper and intelligent then i thought and pretty damn intense but thrilling , its edge of the seat kind of stuff. Even had me quite emotional all i'll say is marbles and no more try getting through that episode with dry eyes not easy . This deserves to become huge !
