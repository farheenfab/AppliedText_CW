@@martyvenkman860 not always. Just because it's in the same genre doesn't mean it is a copy cat. There is a difference between genre and concept/idea. Squid game's genre is thriller. The concept/idea is survival of the fittest. This concept has been used and recycled many times in games, movies and shows . However, genre and concept has nothing to do with copycat. Squid Game is a copycat because it is just too similar to Saw. In other words, it is just Saw : Korean Version.
