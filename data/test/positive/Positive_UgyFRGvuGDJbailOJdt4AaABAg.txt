For the people actually wondering if this is squid game 2.

No it isn't, most of it was from another movie called "Animal World" which was a Chinese adaptation of an anime called "Kaiji: Ultimate Gambler".

Both the movie and anime are pretty good imo.

Edit: It's a real good unofficial trailer actually. This comment is just for the people thinking that this is actually squid game 2.
