Its crazy how actors can look so wholesome in person but in their movie or show they seem completely depressed, angry, a whole different person basically

Edit: bro I kind of regret making this comment. once in a while theres always some  headass making the same comment of “well they are actors.” Yeah they are, but my comment was made more out of being impressed that they did such an amazing job. Can’t appreciate talent without people trying to act smart. It’s like If I were to be impressed that an artist made a great painting and someone is like “yeah well they ARE an artist” yeah no shit I’m just admiring the work
