Do you know the meaning of "Mu Goong Wha Ggot Yi Pee Ut Seum Ni Da" the song of Squi Game?
Indeed, it is for counting 10. The song consists of 10 sounds and its literal meaning is that the Rose of Sharon, the national flower of Korea, has been blossemed. Traditionally Korean kids play the game singing the song to count 10. You should stop before counting 10 in the original game. Actually they make change on counting speed suddenly to increase possibility of moving player at 10.  So, green light and red light are far from the meaning of the song. Why don't you count 10 or sing a song of 10 sounds rather than say green and red lights?
