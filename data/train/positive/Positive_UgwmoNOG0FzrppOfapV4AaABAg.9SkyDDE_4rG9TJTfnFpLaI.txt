@@gina5406 first, Many people are talking about Japanese movie and anime called Battle Royale and Liar Game. Japanese done so much great thing before K-Dramas. I'm not a hater of Kdrama but the way you said that "why japanese didn't do great job like kdrama" lol who are you to talking about japanese. Japanese and Koreans are way better than what you think. Japanese created masterpiece like Battle Royale, Attack On Titan, Liar Game, Steins Gate and many more (The writer of Squid Game said that He is inspired by Japanese movie and anime.) While Koreans created Parasite, Train to Busan etc. Stfu pls
