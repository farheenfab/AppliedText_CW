What my brain processed as I watched the trailer 
One of the games gonna be about solving the Rubik's cube or an important player is always gonna be twisting and solving the Rubik's cube. 
Oh there's a huge tank lik thing with water-this level in the game is gonna be all about holding one's breath inside water longest. 
Ooh can't wait for Mr Beast to recreate this one! 
Omg the hero has joined as an organiser to bring it down from the inside. 
Oooh it's on a ship,this is next level! Maybe the rich guys tryin to escape govt and making sure it's scary for contestants. Next season might be in space. 
Oooooh it's a made up trailer. Nevermind. Back to Hello darkness my friend.
