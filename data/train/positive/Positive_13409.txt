Hi all, I just want to point out that a lot of the scenes in this concept teaser came from a Chinese survival/action film called "Animal World"(Dong Wu Shi Jie), with Yifeng Li and Michael Douglas. In a similar style as the Squid Game but with crazier visuals. As a Squid Game fan myself, I think you should enjoy that film too! Anyone that sees this comment, have a great day!
