Well you just straight up lied and people liked your comment lol. I'm watching the episode and he's highlighted in green as well meaning he could've very well been shot if he decided to move. 

SPOILER FOR THE END: didn't he say he wanted to truly participate in the game? It wouldn't make sense to play the game if he was exempt.
