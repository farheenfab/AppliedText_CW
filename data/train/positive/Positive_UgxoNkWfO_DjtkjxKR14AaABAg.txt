I am watching the trailer for the first time, after watching the show, and I must say, it was pretty much a focal point that each game is a mystery until it starts, and knowing it in advance is such a huge advantage.

That kept me hooked up all over the show and excited to know what is the next game is. So I am really thankful that I did not watch this trailer before watching the show. Thank you.
