nah. my theory is that player 456 well find and rescue the detective and most likely they go after the front man by chasing the dealer the man who  they play the blue and red card game , or  maybe , when we see the end of the first season when player 456 got someone else's card of participation he might sneak in as a player or something like that, cause honestly , there is no other way they could find them again in any other way unless they make a big time skip in the series to take of the time spent finding their next playground, and that's my theory .
