 The media also contributes a lot to shaping our minds to be greedy. A sports car won't usually make you happy, that's just an expensive toy you play with for a few weeks or months and then get bored of it. The human mind didn't evolve over millions of years with the ultimate goal of obtaining yachts and mansions. No wonder rich people are often unhappy, they must always fill this endless void.
