No it's not like that. The front man was the winner of 2015 and they are playing in 2020/2021 . Actually the concept of front man was that the winner with too much money feels money is worthless. There is no excitement in life ( as the old man said in last episode). So he joined the game because he is also rich. But in case of 456 player , i think he will use money for better cause not like other winners.!
