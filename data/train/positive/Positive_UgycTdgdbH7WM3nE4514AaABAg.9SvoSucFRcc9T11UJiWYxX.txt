â€‹ Sorry to break it to you, but even A-List Hollywood royalty like Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Nicole Kidman, etc have all had tremendous amounts of work done on their bodies/faces. But you don't see people whining about it when they make the "best looking" lists. Celebrities whose jobs are to be in the public eye 24/7 usually get plastic surgery. Grow up and stop being a bitter Betsy lol
