This series is so amazing. Like it's so dark but there's a comedic side and that made it so even better to watch. So glad that this series happened to think that it took 10 years. The actors are all amazing. And it amazed me also when I learned that this is Jung Ho Yeon's first acting. She nailed it. Congrats to all the people behind Squid Game
