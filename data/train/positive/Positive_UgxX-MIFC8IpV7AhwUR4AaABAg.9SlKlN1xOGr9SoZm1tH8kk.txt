@Emerald Knight I think ur just salty that Korea is outdoing Japanese media/entertainment in every way possible. Maybe they won an Oscar bc Parasite was a great movie? Maybe this is number one trending bc itâ€™s better made then the thousands of cliche prodigy survival game bs Japan puts out? But sure, the Koreans and their massive political power in the US made them the first non American country to produce an Oscar winning film. Keep being salty that Japan is losing and that Korea is winning
