 by their channel, they have a lot of Japanese characters in their video titles so I think it’s safe to assume she’s either part Japanese or at least fluent in Japanese (unless it’s kanji I’m looking at, in which case yeah she can either be Japanese or Chinese then— I only assumed Japanese because I’ve seen the characters used in written Japanese sentences before; I don’t know what kanji exactly looks like so I wouldn’t know if it was kanji or katakana or hiragana I’m seeing). 
And Chinese is the biggest population in the world, and I think is one of the most common languages spoken in North America next to Spanish and English. So not entirely impossible. I think it’s more possible than it is impossible.
