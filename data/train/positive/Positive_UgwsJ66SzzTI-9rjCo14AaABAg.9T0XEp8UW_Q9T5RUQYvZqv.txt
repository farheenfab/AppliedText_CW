same! i remember watching kdrama back in 2011. it was considered a niche thing back then, same with kpop. you would never tell anyone in case they thought you were weird for liking something in a different language. now its so popular! crazy how things change. kind of sad that its not this niche thing anymore, but im glad its getting its recognition.
