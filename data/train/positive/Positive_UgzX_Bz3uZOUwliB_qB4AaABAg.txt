Honestly Kdramas are actually quite addicting. If your interested in exploring more and wanna try one in a different tone/ genre but still has really great acting, ost and directing like Squid game, I’d recommend “ It’s Okay not to be Okay “, it’s not a thriller but more of an actual drama ( some romance and humour too ) that tackles a lot of situations related to mental health issues. It has a pretty amazing storyline and the actors in this Kdrama are top notch. I wouldn’t say it’s more child friendly ( cause it’s definitely not meant for kids under 15 ) but it’s not something on the crazy level of murder/ killings like squid game. You can also find it on Netflix
