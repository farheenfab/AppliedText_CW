Exactly. I'm shocked it was her first role and at the same time not really. They gave her a character that doesn't really emote much (at least outrightly) so they probably thought it was the safest choice (I'm assuming) but the actress really took the character to a whole other level. She never went out of character and yet she expressed so much feelings behind a stony mask. I understand why that one character garnered such a huge fanbase
