This was so funny! im laughing so hard! thank you so much! the amount of emotions this brought me through was undescribable.i love you with every cell in my body. i have gone through hell and back searching for this clip. i have spent a year and a half looking and now that ive found it. well..... i have no more meaning in life. I will spend the next 25 years of my life watching this video thank you so  much. My favorite part is when they died. I am crying . not tears of anger or sadness or joy but of despare. I love this way too much. i cannot explain how much i love you. its become. The pain of not knowing what this was for that past 12 years was so painstakingly unbearable. thank you. thank every one on the entire memebappe team. i love you.
