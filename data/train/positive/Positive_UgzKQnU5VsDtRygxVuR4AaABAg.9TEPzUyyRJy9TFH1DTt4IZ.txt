 I felt the same way but actually, upon rewatch...their acting isn't terrible. I found that when I tried to disregard their masks, they came off sounding more realistic.   That said, they're definitely not on par with the main cast, but considering that the show was shot out in Korea without a huge movie-scale budget, the studio may have been limited in what they had to work with in terms of English-speaking intentionally foreign actors.
