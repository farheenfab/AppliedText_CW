@@PETBOY Yes, I have. And it’s absolutely lacking any form of originality. Compare it with “As The Gods Will”, the first game is EXACTLY the same and some of the shots are filmed in the EXACT same way, with the EXACT same angles and reactions. A coincidence is fine but this much? It’s clear it was copied.
