It also calls psychology of mass.
Even in reality, when it is mass shooting, a lot of people start running away, instead of hiding around. Now people in school are trained to hide, but imagine there is no training, living in europe, in the situation of mass shooting, most people run away one direction like a mass. But now in schools in US, they teach teachers that they need to basically do not go out of room, but locking the doors, hide and etc because before when it happened the first time, all people are just running to the exit so it is easy for the shooter target them.
