@VGV Tomato wait wait so are you saying that Ali's actor is not actually nice in real life or not? Cause if not then there's no problem here cause I agree with you. Some actors just are naturally good at acting whether their told to or not, if you get what I mean. But I don't think these actors in particular are like that.
