 I totally agree. Music can transform your emotions and thoughts like a light switch. Music is one of the most important and crucial ingredients in bringing forth emotions and has the powerful ability to change the audience’s emotional state! 
That’s power.  

Btw, side note, I think the Minecraft comment was someone essentially saying, “You’re probably some dumb kid playing video games” (since Minecraft is a very popular game where a lot of younger kids start out with playing Minecraft) side note: I love Minecraft and I’m not a kid but that’s not the point lol)  But basically, the Minecraft comment was just a simple insult to another user trying to undermine their intelligence and judgment. Lol Hopefully this makes sense.  

Anywho! I absolutely agree with everything you said about the impact and importance of music! Well said!! 

PS. I think you meant add not ad. I hate ads lmao
