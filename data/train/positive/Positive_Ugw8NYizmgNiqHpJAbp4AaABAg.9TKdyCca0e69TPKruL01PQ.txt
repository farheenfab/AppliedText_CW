I sooo agree with you!!!! Loved Train to Busan, great movie all around.  South Korean shows/movies are definitely top notch and blow a ton of American movies away by a long shot.  Parasite is another fantastic movie.  I love the way the South Korean movies mesh everything together, drama, horror, emotional family issues, education, etc.
