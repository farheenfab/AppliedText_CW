tbh she didn't do much: she just had to keep a strict, impassive face (which is natural considering she's a model) and speak in a minimalistic low tone most of the time. She's a great character and the actress and director obviously played to the strengths and understood not to utilise her as the main focal points of most scenes but that doesn't mean she herself stood out or stands out in terms of other talented young actors and actresses.
