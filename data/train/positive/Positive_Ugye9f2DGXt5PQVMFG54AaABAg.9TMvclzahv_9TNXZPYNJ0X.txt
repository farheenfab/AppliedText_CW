 Isn't that stereotypical and racist? As a black person myself, I'm shocked to see that your so inconsiderate. I'm sure you don't mean it in a bad way but are you black OR asian? Even if you are, I don't think you have room to say that. Educational Level? Are you saying black people can't be as smart as Asian people or something? Considerate vs not? What the hell does that mean? We can BOTH be considerate, because people ANY race can be inconsiderate, or smart. And im sure Biracial AND white people and every other race, INCLUDING Black people and Asians have SOME kind of crime rate. All races are capable of being bad or good, so can you like not say that KNOWING your gonna get controversy, even though you're wrong!?
