Yup, and Netflix will probably bank another billion after all the merchandising is done. The actors, director, set designer, etc. probably signed a contract for a set amount w/ no back points. I'd be surprised if the Jung Ho-yeon made more than a 100k for her work, esp since it was her acting debut. Some would say that she'll make a lot more from now on. True, but there is such a thing as company bonuses for a job well done. 

So here's a suggestion to Netflix: give a bonus of 45 billion won to be divided among everyone involved. It'd be a nice touch.
