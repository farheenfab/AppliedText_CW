This would be so cool if it was real haha. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk commented that it took him 6 months to write the first 2 chapters of the show, and 13 years for them to take his idea seriously. He said that for now he is not thinking of a second season and that he only has a headache thinking about it, I think that in a few years there will be more history of the Squid Game!
