Best show ever, like some comments i want to erease my memory and watch it ALL over again, to break those mysteirues. My favorite show  on Netflix (and other stuff idc), i mean its kinda brutal ESPECIALLY the first episode with that women screaming after realising this games "Eleminates" you for real and MOST IMPORTANTLY she had a wholssme amount of blood in her face the she got *Headshot"-ed. 
And also every Squid Game fan will rewatch this trailer FOR sure.
