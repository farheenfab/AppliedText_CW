.cbc92 My opinion isn't based on Parasite movie, watch "Memories of murder ", "I saw the devil",  "The wailing", "The chaser",  "Oldboy", "mother", "Snowpiercer", "Hope", "Signal", "Beyond evil", "Empress Ki", "Itaewon Class", "It's okay to not be okay", "Descendants of the sun", "Romantic Doctor", "World of the married", "My mister"... Then I'll have an argument with you! Also don't be rude and learn to respect others' opinions.
