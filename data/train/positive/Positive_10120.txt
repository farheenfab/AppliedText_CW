If you recommend this show to someone, tell them to NOT watch the trailer. I personally didn't watch the trailer and now that I finished the series I'm very happy about not watching it. The shock factor of seeing the 'losers' in the first game get just outright gunned out was exiting. The trailer doesn't outright spoil anything but it takes away from the viewing experience.
