god this show was phenomenal genuinely engrossing and amazing. these actors put their heart and soul into it and they are so humble and thankful people. its crazy how different these actors are compared to the western hollywood actors. these people are genuinely humble and concerned about their acting. the show was awesome. it was sad and thrilling. and made me really think about the choices i make in my own life and whether the risk is worth the reward and whether the consequence of my actions is more detrimental than the success
