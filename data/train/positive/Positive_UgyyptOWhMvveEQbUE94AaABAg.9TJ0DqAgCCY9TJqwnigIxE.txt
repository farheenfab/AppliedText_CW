I wish we got more of her too but even with her having so little screen time she was the most memorable character to me since she was so well done. I think her having less screen time made it seem like she’d be the winner since they made it seem like she was gonna be important when she was introduced which really added to the twist and the emotions of her dying instead of Sae-Byok because let’s be real it felt obvious that she would die instead.
