@@teamojesusss Kids play a kid friendly version of red light green light. One person will stand and look at a wall. If they say green light then the others can walk towards them. But at random intervals the person will turn from the wall and say red light. If they see you move then you are out. The aim of the game is to reach the person at the wall without getting caught. Then you have Squid Game’s version, where a giant doll calls red light and green light, and if you’re caught moving then you’re shot.
