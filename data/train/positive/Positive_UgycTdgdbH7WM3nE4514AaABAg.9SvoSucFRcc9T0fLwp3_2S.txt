 what is that surgeon talking about?  60%?  As a korean i can 1000% assure u that's an exaggerated number. Many visual actors and actresses in korea have natural beauty if u look at their younger pictures.. so idk why u keep generalizing? You assume they had surgery if they look like a doll, well look at cha eunwoo  .Im sick of the media painting korea as a country crazed with plastic surgery  when the west is more obsessed with  boob  jobs,lip fillers and  bigger butts  plus a huge number of chinese ppl contributes to the percentage, thousands of foreigners come to korea yearly to get plastic surgery.   heard about surgery tourism? You going those silly kdramas, filled with artificial looking actors -a foreigner, once again generalizing  korea as a plastic surgery obsessed country, preaching about finding ur true beauty yada yada so disrespectful ;; its like seeing those kpoppies rambling about whitewashing idols
