Director Hwang Dong-hyuk definitely knew what he required from each actor/actress and what he wanted for each scene. It seemed like he gave good directorship and worked well with everyone. He even did the casting job to make sure each actor/actress suitable for his/her role. Everyone from top to bottom made this show worked and succeeded even though some people think otherwise that it was over-rated and not original.
