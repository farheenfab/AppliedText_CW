While everyone else was trying to win, Ji-yeong and Kan Sae-byeok were in their own world talking. It was very pure how they bonded to the end even through chaos. I only wished they could have had more scenes to show how great their characters were. These two young girls were braver and more selfless than any other character. They were my favorite. They all deserved so much more
