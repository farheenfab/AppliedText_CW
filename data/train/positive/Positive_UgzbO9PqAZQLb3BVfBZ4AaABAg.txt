What they cannot repeat is the strong, gutwrenching and heartfelt messages and social study part of the show which made it great. I firmly believe the show is going down the path of the SAW movies - a genius first entry that was made from nothing and won over the world, only for the media machine to pick up the least important part of it, the extreme creative violence, and turn it into a franchise of gore porn.
