i know squid game is disliked for its extreme oversaturation and memes but imo its just what happened to among us, amazing content but for a period of time it's all you see and you get burnt out. I watched squiggame in the middle of it's decline in popularity and i must say the show is *really* good. The music that comes in as the guards arrive in the beginning of the game is so strange to hear, it almost seems like a different song because of how well it sets the mood, the whole time i was captivated, so i'm excited for season 2
