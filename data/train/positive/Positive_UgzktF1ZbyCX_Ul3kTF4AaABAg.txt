I Really want to watch this series on Netflix but the reason is I am 13 years old and I can't just tell my parents that I want to watch a 18+ series, I was addicted to mako mermaids (Netflix series) there was just a cheek kiss and my parents were mad at me, if you realy want to watch squid game, money heist this is the best option! And by the way they are telling the story about the game and seong not Ali's death or more information!!
