For me, its everyone of the casts… i dont know why but i just felt the lost everytime any of them died… i rarely watch kdrama and the only series that i completed is hotel de luna. I think korean dramas and movies are sooo good, it makes us feel emotionally attached to the characters.. big props to korean filming industry
