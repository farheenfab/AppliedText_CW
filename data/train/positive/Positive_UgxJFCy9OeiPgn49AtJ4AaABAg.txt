Honestly, if I had watched the trailer first, I probably wouldn’t have watched the show. The only reason I saw it was because it was going around on tiktok a lot and I didn’t want to get spoiled. Highly recommend this show, it's one of the best series I've seen and I'm so glad I didn't watch the trailer first.
