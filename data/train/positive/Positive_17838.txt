I didn’t suspect any of the characters to be the creator of the game, simply because I just assumed the creator of the game would be a random sick freak, especially after we saw the back of the front man, and it didn’t look like anyone we’d seen prior. I really expected a totally new character, I guess I didn’t have high hopes for such a twist but never will I ever underestimate Korean Netflix again.
