I got spoiled for it in my recommendations, oof. I watched the show and didn't get emotionally attached to it, but I still liked it! not one of my favs tho like Danganronpa or YTTD. And I watched the trailer after I finished it and man did this trailer hit hard.. The music was so cool. And the last part with the camera angles were so.. wow!!! It made me tingle but in a cool way ya know?
