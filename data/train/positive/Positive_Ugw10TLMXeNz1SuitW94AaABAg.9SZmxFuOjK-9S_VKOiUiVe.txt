@kmj all the games appear in this show are traditional Korean children games that has been existed for more than hundreds of years or maybe even more than 1000 years. In which country do u find games like this? Squid game? Dalgona(melting sugar) game, etc? I’m assuming ur just butthurt to the fact that K dramas are flying when ur country’s shows are complete trash.
