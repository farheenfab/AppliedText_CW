 tv shows: running man, crime scene season 2, young's kitchen season 2, heroes (old show, my first Korean show ) I watched these shows and  more and I liked them all  (you will enjoy Korean tv shows even more when you get into different things in their culture, you will have better understanding and knowledge of celebrities, humor... they are the best for entertainment (for me) (music, drama, shows...) (for a series I recommend "Mother ","Hotel Del Loona", goblin, "my love from the star", it's ok not to be ok"...
