@A.satwik Achary But in the end I read that he sacrificed himself because even if he had won he would still have to face the shame of his former debt issues. Think about it, he graduated top of his class at SNU and then years later bargains way too much money and ends up in debt. He was too afraid to actually admit to his mom the truth and you could see how uncomfortable he was whenever Gihun brought up his academic achievements. In the end he just wanted to spare himself of feeling embarrassed and hurting his pride and ego. That’s why he let Gihun win, I don’t think it had anything to do with their former friendship.
