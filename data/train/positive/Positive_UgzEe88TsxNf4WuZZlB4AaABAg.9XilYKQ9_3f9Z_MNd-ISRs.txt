  -> 10 syllables in Korean. In order to play with kids who have not yet known how to count from 1 to 10, they started to use a sentence with 10 syllables instead of counting to 10. When I was young, sometimes we used that sentence for Seek and Hide as well, instead of counting from 1 to 100. Like asking a 5 years old boy as a tagger, " You don't  know how to count from 1 to 100. Okay! Then, just repeat that  famous sentence 10 times. It would be the same as counting to 100! Ater that, seek us!"
