Actually many korean think her acting was little bit awkward. Of course she has a beautiful face and voice tone, but It was her first acting (she was a model before) so many scenes were cringe. And her role (North Korean) is hard to act because their language has very subtle tone what is different from South Korea. Many Korean felt it was quite awkward. But I believe she'll do better next time!
