 its because of her exaggerated gestures that's why you think she is doing the most stuff, but replay it and only listen to the iPad girl, she made the most sound and is often the primary singer especially 0:16 onwards, she is just not noticable because she doesn't move as much like the right girl and has an ipad covering her face.....and she doesn't look like she is singing because she hardly opens her mouth lol

Lol at first I didn't even notice the left girl is singing, I thought she is just there to hold the ipad because she sings without opening her mouth, here in 0:16 you can see my point, the primary sound is really just her's and the other ones are adding more sounds to enhance her sound
