Also a game of Ring around the rosey, they place you on a merry-go-round and start at a slow pace.

Blindfolded darts but with two people per board. The kicker? You're allowed to look at the board for exactly one minute and you're blindfolded right after and your partner is placed by the board much like decendents the goal is to not hit your partner or try not to brutally mame them. The one with the lowest score first two rounds would determine who is on the "chopping block."
