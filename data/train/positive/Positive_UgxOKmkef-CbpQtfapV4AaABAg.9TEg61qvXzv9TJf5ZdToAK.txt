Stuff like this literally happens every day in the real world, just maybe not in the way we think. It‘s not like a 1:1 Squid Game Replica. 
But rich people misusing their power is a real thing, and I would not be surprised if stuff like this happened / is happening on the dark web or some ‚secret‘ places that only some people have access too.
I mean if there is people being trafficked each and every day, In the broad daylight in big cities and people are not even noticing that, then how would you notice any other things going on.

But I mean if we did have gladiator fights thousands of years ago, I am not surprised that human behavior like this is still in our DNA somehow, and that people having so much wealth and power get bored and loose touch with reality to set up people playing games for their entertainment.
There are some human trafficking survivor stories that literally talk about having to play weird sexual games and watching the other people get murdered or so infront of them if they did not obey.

The real world can be a VERY dark place
