firstly -- this is amazing. THE TALENT & SKILL REQUIRED IS EVIDENT. Secondly -- the concept of them moving the game to someplace portable like a ship in the middle of the ocean, to prevent further risk of exposure and being caught, is such a strong prediction. It would make complete sense, and I wouldn't be surprised if season 2 actually involved some sort of massive location change. 10/10 LIVE for this.

*update -- just to be clear, I'm completely aware that this is a fanmade trailer, and obviously they're using clips from other media sources to bring it to life (as most fan trailers require). My point was just that the idea of moving the squid game onto a portable location scenario would be a good idea for season 2, and one that I hadn't thought of prior to this video. I was unfamiliar with "Kaiji", and therefore, from my perspective, was not aware that the plot for this TeaserPRO was anything other than a 'strong prediction', let alone a 'stolen' concept. I was strictly thinking in the realm of the show the trailer lists in its title. Therefore, I apologize for any cringy statements that may cause one to 'facepalm'--I meant no offense or insult to any sources of media which may have been used for inspiration.*
