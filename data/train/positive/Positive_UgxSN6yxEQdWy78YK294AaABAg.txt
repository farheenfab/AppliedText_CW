One of the best parts of this show was the sets, they were so detailed and so big. It was so cool seeing all these massive rooms for the players to play in. Another insanely good part of the show was the costumes, from the blue tracksuits of the players to the pink suits and shaped masks of the guards it just gave this really unhuman atmosphere where the people we saw as people where the players as anyone under a mask didn't feel human and felt thoughtless. This show was on a completely other level and I can't wait to rewatch it again but this time with subtitles instead of dubbed!
Love the show!
Edit: Haha this is the most likes I have ever got on a comment, thanks!
