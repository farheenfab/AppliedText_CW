 yeah and not to mention she had to speak with North Korean accent in some scenes other than this is her acting debut. Idk how well she did the accent since I don't speak Korean but I'm just saying that it's reasonable that she was worried since for most people acting with their own accent is already hard enough. She's a model though so she should have the basics when it comes to body language and facial expressions because modelling is a little bit like acting I suppose.
