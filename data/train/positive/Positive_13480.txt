I want to see new games like “The floor is lava!”
 Edit: I have more ideas
Limbo (lasers)
Hop scotch (land mines)
Hide and seek (from guards)
Dodge ball (acid water balloons)
Simon says (do exactly what instructor or guard tells you to do)
Musical chairs (it’s a group game person without a chair gets killed)
Riddles (you must solve 3 riddles under 7 minutes total)
