The way that they brought back the girl after the marble game got me. So my theory is, 001 was not meant to be picked. He was the odd one out and no one was going to pick him because of his age. If everyone else partnered up, then it would be no questioning why 001 did not show up after the game concluded. He would have been "killed" and just got to watch and bet on the games with everyone else. But because he was chosen by 456, he got to experience the last game in person, and that's why he wasn't too keen on playing it, and rather just getting to experience the environment in person. However during the game, he knew he wasn't supposed to win to go on to the next game, so he faked his dementia and forgetfulness to both teach 456 a lesson about trust and give him an out to winning. That way he could leave the game and 456 could continue. But they put the girl back in because they were expecting her to play, and not playing want fair to her. They wanted everyone to have an equal chance, which is why they were trying to take 001 out by pairing everyone up, because he wasn't supposed to win.
