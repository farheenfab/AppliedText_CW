It wasn't "the point" or intended, there is just no need for foreign language actors to act well. because you become less sensitive to the actor's acting skills if they are speaking in a foreign language. The main target audience was korean ppl, so no need for english speakers to act good. goes for the same in hollywood movies, as a korean i can tell the korean speaking scenes in those are really unnatural and stiff, but english speakers just need to identify that the actors are speaking korean and they just read the eng subs.
