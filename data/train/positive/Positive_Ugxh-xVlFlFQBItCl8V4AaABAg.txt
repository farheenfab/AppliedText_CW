I hope to see Jung Hoyeon more on masterpiece acting projects like Squid Game. She's so good. And Wi Hajun is so handsome! I hope to see him in a drama that he is the male lead in the future because of all the dramas I've seen him he is just second lead. Hopefully he'll get offer of male lead after this. Also Lee Jung Jae and Park Haesoo are such brilliant actors. I cant wait for Money Heist kor adaptation. So excited for season 2. Fighting Squid Game Squad!
