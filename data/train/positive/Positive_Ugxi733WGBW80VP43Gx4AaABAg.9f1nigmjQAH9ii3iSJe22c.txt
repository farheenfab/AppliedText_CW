I just watched the game parts and they were one of the disturbing things I watched. I think it is mostly because of the shocking effect of putting the innocent and evil together in child games and this creates an extremely unsafe area where you lose your trust even in child games' innocence and start to question their sincerity since then. You die not in a fight or not in a war but in an innocent child game with colourful candies, baby dolls and marbles. That's too much to handle.
