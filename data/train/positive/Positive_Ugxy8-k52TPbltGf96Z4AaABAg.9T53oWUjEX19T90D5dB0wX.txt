 Are you a teen? I just watched this Alice series a lot of cringy  moronic teen shit drama, only a moron would find it honestly better than squid game. Huge reach with the scifi and many unrealistic saves, while squid game is more show for adults, as people are more realistic and in realistic financial scenarios , even the game it self could be a possibility with enough money to spend on entertainment.The emotions and resolutions of games even tho they are simple children games in this show are more profound and each carry weight its not just plot armor kids jumping from window to another and dodging bullets like its matrix. Honestly squid game is far superior and more mature, while other show has more appeal to kids and teens.
