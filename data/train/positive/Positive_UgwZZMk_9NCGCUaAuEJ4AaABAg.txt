I watched this trailer 9 hours ago and now I'm back after binge-watching all the episodes. I've watched Battle Royale and thought this would be much the same with survival, lots of killing, and plenty of plot twists. Yes, this show does all three but man, it does all three and so much more. The characters, acting, production, cinematography, pacing - honestly everything was mind-blowingly good. I wish I could go back to 9 hours ago so I can rewatch this show without knowing what happens next. Genuinely one of the best shows out there.
