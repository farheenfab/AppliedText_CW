It’s been about 2 days since I finished this show and it has genuinely not left my mind ever since. I usually never leave reviews on shows/movies I watch either, so me leaving one for this show speaks volumes to just how much I enjoyed Squid Game. The acting is beyond phenomenal in my opinion and evoked emotions in me that I had never felt in any other show before. (this review is spoiler free, don’t worry.) Every little detail that went into the production value, the acting, the plot, the character development, the set designs, EVERYTHING was just absolutely amazing. I went into this show thinking I would mostly enjoy it and that would be it, however I did not expect it to impact me as much as it did. The hype Squid Game is receiving at the moment is very much deserved, and I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone who hasn’t seen it/needs something new to binge on. (really, I finished all 9 episodes in one sitting. over 9 hours.) I have been recommending this show to everyone I know so far and even if you aren’t the biggest fan of violent/bloody shows I genuinely believe to give this one a chance, you won’t be disappointed. This show has something for everyone; it’s emotional, dramatic, comedic at times, and has enough blood scenes for suspense/thrill lovers to enjoy. I really cannot explain enough just how much I love this show, it’s one of my favorites on Netflix now that’s for sure. Kudos to the cast and team behind this show as well, they’ve worked so hard and all the hard work that went into production is rightfully paying off. So if you have been looking for a sign on whether or not to watch Squid Game, this is your sign.
