@@TheElpilar Actually, what you see in the video is not the red light green light game you used to play. They just translated/dubbed that way so people outside Korea can easily relate to (or understand) the game.  How the game is actually played in the video (and in Korea in general) is that when a person (in the video, a doll) sings a phrase you can move, when the singing stops, you must stop.  The singing can begin at any time. The singing can also stop at any point in the phrase. The singing can be slower or faster. The singing can also start slow but go faster or vice versa.  It's the similar concept as the red light/green light game, but slightly more complicated and that makes the game uniquely Korean.
