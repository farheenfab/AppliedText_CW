the part that gave me chills afterwards was during the marble game when il-nam starts saying "this is my old house,, my kid and his friends would play games in here and i would stand in and watch but they didnt know i was here" but this is literally the entire show summed up, all of the players are kids playing games in il-nams house without knowing that hes behind it
