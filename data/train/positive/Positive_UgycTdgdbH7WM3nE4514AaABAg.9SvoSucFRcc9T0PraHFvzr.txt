 lol keep on believing that 60% of Korea has plastic surgery if you need to cope that bad. “Sharper eye”? This is about statistics idiot and quite frankly there is no way 60% of the entire population has gotten plastic surgery. That would make Korea by far not only the leaders in per capita plastic surgery but in total procedures as well, which isn’t true because several countries like the US, Brazil, etc. all have way more procedures yearly than Korea does. And this ain’t even taking into account the amount of medical tourism that Korea experiences and the foreigners that have procedures in Korea as well. And even common sense would tell you that 60% of the entire country hasnt done plastic surgery. Ur acting as if plastic surgery is some minor procedure anyone can do, not an invasive surgery that costs tens of thousands of dollars to get. If you think it’s feasible that 60% of all Koreans have gotten plastic surgery ur a dumbass. Stop bullshitting and trying to take the moral high ground we all know why you bought up plastic surgery on the first place lmao.
