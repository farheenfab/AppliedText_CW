@@sara.cbc92  copycat of what? Don’t tell me you are comparing to Japanese dramas because they are so cringe with zero character development and poor acting skills . I guess hunger games copied too then . The winner is the one who can take an idea and can go beyond playing mere games. Squid Game is not a visual focussed game based series. It’s more the characters, psychological and behavioural aspects of human beings.
