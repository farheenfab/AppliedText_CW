There has never been a time in history that the entire Korean peninsula was a colony of China.
Gojoseon, Goguryeo, Goryeo~ : Am I joke to you?? hahahahahahahahaha^^^^
the only human beings who make such ignorant claims supported by the government are the germs in mainland China.
Of course you learn from Chinese textbooks written by China, so what can you know about that? the only makes china is the superior yeah yeah~~ 
Did you see Japanese textbooks written by Japan or Korean textbooks written by Korea?
How much do textbooks written by the United States or the Western world know about the history of the other region?
They are all described by large countries and their current national power.
During the Yuan and Qing dynasties, there were times when Korea were subordinate states, 
but at that time the entire Han Chinese were also colonies and subordinate states too^^ 

Our hanbok was influencing Yuan dynasty.  And it is originally from Goguryeo~and three kingdom Baekje Silla which is even older than Tang dynasty~^^

That was great history, Han Chinese was being kept as slaves in every house, and all women could be used as prostitutes. 
Han Chinese women conceived children of Mongolian men and their descendants are present-day China.

China is descended from Mongolia. ^lol^~

There has never been a single dynasty of more than 300 years in Chinese history.
china is all mongrel dogS~ wolf~ wolf~


Please Live the present~ not the past like 1000 or 2000 years ago 

Only chinese live in the past~ the only~^^^ chinese don`t like it then get the time-machine and go back to the history not in the US platform Youtube and Western civilization.
