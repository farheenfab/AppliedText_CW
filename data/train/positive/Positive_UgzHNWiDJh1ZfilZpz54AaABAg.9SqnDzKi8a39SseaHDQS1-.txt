@@user-kt9yq7iy9j i understand, but considering allot of east asian culture influenced one another, i dont see much of a problem. the series was trying to represent the games south koreans played as a kid and i think its normal for east asians to even share the same childhood.. they never claimed it to be a korean game.

(speaking from a southeast asian that also shared the same experience)
