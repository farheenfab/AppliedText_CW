@@kate109 fr, alice in borderland show is thrilling as hell, and gives it the dark horrific vibes. While, imo squid game ofc is more thrilling, and it is horror but doesn't make it horrific just thrilling and exciting imo, but tbh, alice in borderland is great too considering the dark thrilling world game they live at. Shows are both great and exciting but one makes me scared and other one makes me thrill while watching it.
