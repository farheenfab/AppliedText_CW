This is so adorable
They're all so different irl
Heo Sung-tae, Park Hae-soo, Jung Ho-yeon and Kim Joo-ryeong are POLAR OPPOSITES of their characters in Squid Game
Deok-su is horrible, his actor is really sweet
Sang-woo is evil, his actor is good
Sae-byeok is cold hearted, her actress is fun-loving and cheerful
Mi-nyeo is a Karen, her actress is a nice, professional lady
All of the actors and actresses are awesome, lovable people. This video made my day <3
