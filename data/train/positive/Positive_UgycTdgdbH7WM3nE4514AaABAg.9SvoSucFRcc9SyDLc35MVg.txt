In those silly k-dramas, most actors have had several plastic surgeries. Maybe some from this cast have too, but they are still more normal looking (although goodlooking) than in some other series. From the looks of it, the one who plays the policeman hasn't done anything. I think that's good; to celebrate the typical Korean features instead of everyone having done their eyes, jaws, noses, boobs and more.
