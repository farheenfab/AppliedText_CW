K-Dramas just never stop exceeding your expectations. This is what happens when you turn your familiar 'B'-level Hollywood trope into an 'A'-level modern classic. I had to finish the series overnight, and could not stop thinking about how good it was, even while watching a movie in the theatres. That's how good this was: The trailer does not do justice for the series. A must watch.
