@@haasss7737 Korea has copied Japan throughout the whole of media history. “Boys Over Flowers”? Originally Japanese. “Oldboy”? Based on a manga. “Liar Game”? Originally Japanese. Should I keep going? Even Korean foods like “Kimbap” are based off “Maki”. Oh, and then there’s the fact that early Kpop groups were literally coming out on stage with Visual-Kei esque hairstyles. Korea has constantly been copying Japan and it’s honestly embarrassing.
