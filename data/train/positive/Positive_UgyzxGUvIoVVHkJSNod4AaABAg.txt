Honestly i think what I love about this show is you can feel the love of film in the set design, costume design, props and storytelling. So many shows and movies have great concepts but don't execute it to the fullest. Either because they dont want to take the time or money to work on all these details or sometimes they don't know how. They did an amazing job on this whole production and the writing and editing and all around, yea this is a hit!!
