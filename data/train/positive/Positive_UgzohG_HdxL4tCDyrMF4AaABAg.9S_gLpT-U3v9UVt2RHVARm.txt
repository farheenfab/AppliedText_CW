@@mywifeleftmeandtookthekids4785 Penthouse is a K-drama with a lot of gory scenes but its really fun. If you like movies about crime, mystery, and drama I highly recommend it. I watched it in a Korean app and there are no sub/dub for it I don’t think- I watched it in Korean without sub because Im Korean myself 
There’s also a K-drama called Guardian (I think? In Korean it’s called , which in English translates to “Goblin”). It’s romance and the salesman from Squid Game- the one that did the game with Gi Hun- is one of the main characters.
