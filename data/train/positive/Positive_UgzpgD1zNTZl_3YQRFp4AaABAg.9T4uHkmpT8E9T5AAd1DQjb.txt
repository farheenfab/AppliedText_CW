@@sugarkitty2008 that's what I thought about too! It could be that he was just that confident about winning the first few games, since he knew which ones were going to be played (I mean he chose them himself). But like... Even if you're good at the dalgona game for example, you could still be unlucky and have it break, so it's not a valid argument...
I think he was going to take the risk for fun, since he was going to die soon anyway
