Wi Hajoon is finally getting the recognition he deserves  He is such a versatile actor and highly underrated but I'm soo happy to see him being famous from Squid Game. He's done many supporting roles and main roles as well. His recently released thriller movie Midnight is amazing, I hope y'all can watch it.
