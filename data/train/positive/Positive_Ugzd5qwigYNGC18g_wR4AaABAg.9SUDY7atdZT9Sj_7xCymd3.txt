@@SB-ls7qj Ya, I can see your point of view as well. I personally saw the game as a metaphor for life. We all make sacrifices in life for the things we want. Some will make sacrifices for themselves, to escape the unreasonableness of society or for loved ones. There's no need to feel ashamed for doing what you have to for the ones you love. Maybe his decision at the end was to make the better place or maybe it was for vengeance, but it doesn't change the fact that he is sacrificing his daughter in the process. That may be justice for the world, but it is a great injustice to the child. I think it really only sinks in what his decision means for his kid once you've experienced it yourself.
