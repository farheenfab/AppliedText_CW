  I'm no actor, but everyone is entitled to their opinion on what is good acting, but I do admit, I think it is more about the style of acting between American and Korean, and overall Asian movies. Korean likes to exaggerate on certain expressions with wide eyes and open mouths. It's common in other Korean movies. Squid Game over did it in episode one that it seemed comical.
