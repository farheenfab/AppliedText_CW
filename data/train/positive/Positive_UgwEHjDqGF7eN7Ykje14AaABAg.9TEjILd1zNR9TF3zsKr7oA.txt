sang woo had to what he had to do to survive, as much as we might hate him, if you were in his position most of you would have done the same, you cant really blame him so he is not entirely a bad person like deouk su but hes also not entirely good like gi hun, thats why he is in the middle and is in the grey area, and gi hun is the normal humane one or somewhat the good one on the least fight and i dont forgive sang woo for killing sae byeok or betraying ali like that but i do sure feel bad for him here
