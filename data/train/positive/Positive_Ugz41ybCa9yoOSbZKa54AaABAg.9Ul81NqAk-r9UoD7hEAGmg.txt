You’re supposed to believe some people have different responses to the same stimuli, which is an undeniable truth. 

You’re trying to tell me that, _seeing_ someone get shot for moving, you would think “Surely the same thing won’t happen to me!” and start moving before you’re clear to? 

That as many people panicked as we saw is already an example of your claim playing through, surprise surprise, some people recognize _when_ the time to run is.
