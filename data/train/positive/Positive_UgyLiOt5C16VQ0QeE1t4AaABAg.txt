I honestly don't know why people feel the need to edit the scene and add more dramatic music. The scene is perfect as it is. There is no dramatic music because nobody (including the viewer) really knows what the stakes are exactly in the games just yet. But also when people start dying the music doesn't change or anything because those have always been the stakes and nothing has changed everybody has just now been clued into what those stakes are. It's great and I don't see why people have the need to edit it when the scene is fantastic istelf.
