The old man didn’t pick the star. The protagonist picked the umbrella, thus leaving star as the last option. The old man paused (because he knew the game so he felt hesitant when the protagonist picked the umbrella). The protagonist picked up on the pause and asked the old man if he wanted to switch. I think the old man liked the protagonist back then but not enough to “sacrifice himself”. But he did during the marble game later on.
