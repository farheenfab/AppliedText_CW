It's hard to remake this with american remake. Squid Game had a lot of korean cultural references that is embedded in games itself, language wise word play and terms aren't easily translated and would lose it meaning.

PEOPLE SEEM TO TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT. I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING THAT THEY COULDN'T. I JUST SAID THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD, UNLESS IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VERSION. I've seen a lot of Americanized version of shows i used to watch like dragon balls, death note etc.... that's why I said this. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT.
ENGLISH ISN'T MY FIRST LANGUAGE SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND
