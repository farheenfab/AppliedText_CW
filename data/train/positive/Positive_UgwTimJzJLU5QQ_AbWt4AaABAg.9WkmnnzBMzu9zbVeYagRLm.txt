Tbf most probably ran for a second, but were smart enough to realize that if the budget for the game set they where in was that expensive, then they would totally be able to easily pick off evreybody who runs, and the reason they weren't caught is because the dolls vision was literally zooming around the playing field and goig  left right and center, and since the dols visik was freaking out, alot of people probably got away with moving, you can even see there are quite a few that are facing backwards whilst the instructions are being repeated, so yeah many started to run but didnt when they saw everyone who was running get shot and also realised its red light so best action is to not move
