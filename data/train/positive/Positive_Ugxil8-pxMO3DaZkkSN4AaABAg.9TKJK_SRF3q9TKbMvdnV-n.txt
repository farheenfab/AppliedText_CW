 yes i know, that's exactly what I meant! They're musicians like a pianist or a violinist but instead their musical instrument is their voice therefore they don't need any other musical instruments( like piano, violin, etc.) except their vocals/voice or in other words themselves. (so technically they're the only musical instrument that they'll need). (and I wrote that comment from the point of view of someone that doesn't know they're vocalists).
