 It's actually not clear whether they had a Front Man before the old man started to die. In-ho won 5 years ago in 2015 and none of the new winners became Front Man. I think it's speculated that the old man went back and asked him to become it, or that he went back to Squid Game on his own because he couldn't re-adjust to living in society (same as Gi-hun at the end).
