.cbc92 bet you're not even japanese, but a 'japanese-wannabe' lolz or should i say 'asiaboo' ? bc you might be just a westerner who wanted to be an asian or japanese most likely. but sorry to say, no. just be yourself and go live your life. RESPECT other countries/races/cultures because that will make this fuvked up world peace. respect others if you wanted to be respected by others too. think about it back. btw, stay safe in this pandemic !
