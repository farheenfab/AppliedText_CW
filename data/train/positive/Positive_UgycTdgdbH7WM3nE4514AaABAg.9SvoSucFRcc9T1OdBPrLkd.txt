 your comments say : in those silly kdramas most actors get several plastic surgeries,  they all look pretty cause they get surgeries, most actors feel like they have to get surgeries in order to be hired ... inspecting the police officer's face and saying its good cause it looks like he didnt get anything done. ..ppl are uncomfortable w your comment cause its uncalled for ,generalizing and disrespectful.  Defense mechanism? Lol no stop making comments about other ppl's faces.
