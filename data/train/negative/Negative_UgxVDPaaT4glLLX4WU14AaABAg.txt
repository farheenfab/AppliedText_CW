i’m so sick of ppl saying squid game is overrated. it’s not. it’s good ASF. this show is something soo much different from anything i’ve seen in my life. the whole plot and concept of this show are good asf! when i first watched squid game i was so nervous and scared for everything, especially after the first game in the show. it’s so different and has that weird vibe that makes it good and interesting. the acting and casting are 10/10. the show is so good and i cant wait for s2 it’s not overrated it deserves the hype it gets!!!
