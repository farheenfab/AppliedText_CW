@@lil7725 there were some fans who wanted sae byeok And her friend to win(which too was realistically impossible coz they are like the 2 weakest girls ever, they reached that far only coz of the group they were in.)  So him going after the squid game guys makes much more sense than the story I said earlier, he don't have anything to loose now, his daughter is living a good life and his mom died, so going after them makes sense as he's got nothing to loose now.
