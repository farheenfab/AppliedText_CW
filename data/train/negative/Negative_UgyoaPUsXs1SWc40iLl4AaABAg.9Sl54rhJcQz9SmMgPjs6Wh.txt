*SPOILERS AHEAD* It wasn't just greed that caused what happened in the movie, they deliberately picked people who were in debt for various reasons and were desperate. It wasn't just greed but people were desperate for relief from the lives they were living, half of the people originally didn't want to continue the games once they realized their deadly nature but once they got back to the lives they hated they went back.
