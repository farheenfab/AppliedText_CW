I dont want to be mean, i couldnt even create a song by myself and i know you wont mind/read my opinion, but after listening psytrance more then 10 years ill have to say that it is a shame to call this psytrance. ItÂ´s EDM or something like that, but with every honor, you cant call this psytrance anymore. The song by itself is ok, nothing special, but i miss the feelings and emotions.
