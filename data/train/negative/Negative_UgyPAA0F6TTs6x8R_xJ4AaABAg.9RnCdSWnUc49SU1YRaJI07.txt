I found the ending (from the moment he is released to the very last second) to be bittersweet... kinda sour, because I was hoping for him to at least enjoy the money like an eccentric millionaire, that's what I would do, that's what everyone would do, but he was too in shock, he saw friends die, people betray eachother, a whole organization behind this twisted entertainment... as he said to his daughter's step father "You think money will really solve everything?!" he won the game, but loose everything in the process, even his mom, his childhood friend, his hope. 
At the very end, when he was about to enter the airplane to leave to USA, he got a new think to live for: prove to that twisted organization that people struggling with money and debts are not "race horses" or disposable entertainment. 
Is not the happy ending we expected. Is a realistic ending, with the main character totally broke emotionally and mentally after the games.
