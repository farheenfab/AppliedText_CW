This scene is even more terrfying. The way they start running and bang the door, so many innocent lives lost so fast and so brutally and unfairly. I don't understand why the squid game makers just want to kill people and I don't understand why they decided to come back even tho the games were so evil and disgusting. It annoys me so much how evil the gamemakers were.
