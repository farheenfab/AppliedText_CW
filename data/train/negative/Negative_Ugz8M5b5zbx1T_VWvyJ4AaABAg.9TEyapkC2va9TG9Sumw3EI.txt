 I think most valuable player doesn't necessarily mean best, kinda like in dragon ball, goku is the best and strongest, but alot of characters outshine him, android 17 was the mvp in tournament of power because he won

just the most useful and accomplished the most things, she is the one doing the high notes, which is used alot in this video, I'm not saying right girl is useless or anything, I'm just saying left girl carried the song with her high orchestral voice

I think the real best one is the guy with the curly hair or yes, the right girl because they do their job amazingly but most valuable is left girl because her choir voice is used alot in the video, especially 0:16 onwards




Or maybe you're right that mvp actually means best and I am in the wrong, I don't really care lol
