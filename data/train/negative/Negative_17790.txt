There are 2 versions of English subtitles for the series Squid Game. One is 'English' and the other one is 'English CC'. The subtitle 'English' is good enough but 'English CC' is terribly horrible. I've heard that somebody mentioned about this issue on Twitter, and I believe the person was talking about 'English CC'. Unfortunately, Netflix recently revised the good one 'English', which means Netflix does not even know what the problem is. Guys. Please click the subtitle saying 'English', not 'English CC'. I'm a South Korean who understands English. Believe me.
