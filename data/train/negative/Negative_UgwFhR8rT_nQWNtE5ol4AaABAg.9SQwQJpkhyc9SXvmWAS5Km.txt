@@snickeringpigeon4370 Amen, it's the worst part since the character thought it was a 2v2 partner thing and never realized the twist in that game

 inner part of me shipped the girls (no judge lol) and wanted them to just get out and be rich, then raised the boy while sipping Mojitos at their Hawaii vacation :'(

The worst part is that the girl's sacrifice kinda was useless in the end, if u know what i mean..
