I want to play a game. For years you have been a cookie cutter going your own cookie cutter ways, now you will be put to the test. In the metal tin in front of you you will notice inside there is a cookie with a shape on it, you must carve out the shape with a sewing needle.
You will be timed, and just so you know if you happen to carve out the cookie you will walk out 
Unscathed with a Christmas cookie but if you fail and break the shape you will die. 
Itâ€™s up to you now to prove what kind of cookie cutter you really are. You have five minutes
                          Make your choice.
