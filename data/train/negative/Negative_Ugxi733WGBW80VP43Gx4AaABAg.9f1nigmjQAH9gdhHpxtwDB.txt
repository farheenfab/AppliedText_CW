The show is themed around capitalism and the dehumanisation of the poor. It’s actually a great allegory for how capitalism claims to allow for upward mobility but instead is rigged in favour of the privileged (equality v equity) and how instead of punching upward, the working class are manipulated into fighting amongst themselves for scraps. The violence is portrayed as horrifying and when the winner of the games emerges, it’s not celebrated. Great show, you should definitely watch it.
