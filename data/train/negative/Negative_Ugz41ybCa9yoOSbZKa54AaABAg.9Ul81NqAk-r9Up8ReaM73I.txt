 You know what’s also an automatic response? Shock. That _precedes_ the fight or flight response, and is the key reason behind the second guy’s death. 

He (and everyone else, for that matter) sees the first guy go down, and assume he’s dicking around and being dramatic. The entire lead-up to him getting shot is him in shock, then making the conscious decision to flee. His death _further_ informs the rest of the players, who likely had come to their own conclusions by then (some accurately, others as unprepared as he was). 

There _was_ communication done, but it was not included in this clip. Those seen moving even a bit were targeted quickly, so you don’t get your dragged out pleas. 

You seem to mistake this for a horror (where there is no chance) when it’s very openly a thriller (there is a chance, but you had better be on your best game to take it properly).
