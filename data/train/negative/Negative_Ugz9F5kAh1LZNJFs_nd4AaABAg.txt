They should really do a season 2.
 
I didn't like how the asian detective just died for no purpose on that island, trying to uncover the grand scheme.

And the ending .. oh boy, it made me think that Seong Gi-hun would go back to destroy the Squid Games..

They really need to pair these 2 dudes up and then uncover the whole situation created by that old fart, Ggambu !
