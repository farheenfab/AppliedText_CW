 In 2019, 40.1% of non-Hispanic whites age 25 and older had a bachelor’s degree or higher, up from 33.2% in 2010. During the same period, the percentage of blacks age 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher rose from 19.8% to 26.1%; Asians from 52.4% to 58.1%; and Hispanics from 13.9% to 18.8%...so if whites are "exceptionally uneducated" you must have very disparaging words against Hispanics and blacks
