@@Sebbir of course he would lie and manipulate. its a game of death, you're gonna put yourself before everyone. the game is not for trusting or making friends, people are in dept and in horrible places you can't expect them to be trusting and caring. + there were 400+ people, telling a few people who would probably die sooner or later to pick the wrong shape isn't much of a risk factor. and how would he know to keep more people? its not like he knew the upcoming games.

i am not a huge huge fan of sangwoo, but he's extremely well written and realistic. curious to hear your opinion! feel free to disagree ^^
