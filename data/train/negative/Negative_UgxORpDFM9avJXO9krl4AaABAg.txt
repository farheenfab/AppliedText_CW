This is the scene that gets everyone hooked. The doll makes it weird and dreamlike, and the shootings are brutally shocking. I think the blond man dies first because his only strategy is to run very fast towards the finish line, but he runs in such a silly way, like a silly loping dog running for a ball, so when he suddenly has to stop, he has already thrown himself off balance.
