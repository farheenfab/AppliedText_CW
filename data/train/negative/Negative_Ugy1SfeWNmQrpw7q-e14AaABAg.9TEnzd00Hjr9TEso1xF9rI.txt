I just rewatched Squid Games a second time and it really makes me realize even more how bad the American actors were  
Their "acting" sounded the exact same as back in school when I and other classmates had to act out a conversation for a scenario during English lessons.
It really was just bad. Except for that everything in the show was fricking amazing tho.
