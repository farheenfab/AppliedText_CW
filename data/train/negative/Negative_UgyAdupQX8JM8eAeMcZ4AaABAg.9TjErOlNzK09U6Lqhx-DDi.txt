@Ruurr Dudud Her character was written to try and hide her emotions so she wasn’t perceived as weak.  The fact that we saw the subtleties was amazing enough— especially towards the last episodes where Jiyoung sacrificed herself and also when she was trying to hide the pain from her injury.  In fact, I’d argue her role was much more difficult to act in comparison to most of the other characters because your micro expressions shouldn’t match your body language for this role
