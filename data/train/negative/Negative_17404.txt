I think he was genuinely participating in the death games, and could have died for real in any of the games. The reason for him dropping out alive at the marble game was he didn't actually lose, he let Gifun win with cheating, and thus it was unfair. That's why he has a rematch with him later. Also, it would be unfair for him to participate in the glass bridge game, because he knew the order you go in is important, and might have even known which ones were real or fake. There was a very heavy emphasis on the theme of being fair, and any of the other games reflected that. The only game that could have been unfair was the honeycomb one, but he didn't choose the shape, he let the group he was in choose it for him.
