Many humans, specially in big cities have become ever more apart from one another. Their God is money and they have no social or emotional attachments to other people. Many pass by a homeless person and it's like they are avoiding an obstacle on the street. They see a person get assaulted or killed on TV and won't even flinch. Sometimes I fear for what the future of humankind might look like.
