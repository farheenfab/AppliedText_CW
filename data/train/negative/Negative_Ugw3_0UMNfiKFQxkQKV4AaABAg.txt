First game:Cards
You have 10 cards Get the most cards and give all 20 cards to the guards 4 cards have the ability to injure your opponent or give 2 cards to you

Death:You get thrown by 19 very sharp cards on your body and the final one that will slice your neck

2nd game:Battle royal(cmon you need entertainment) 

You all get knocked out and the guards will dress you up as a guard but with a question mark so that you won't be able to know who or how to speak on your mask on
You are given a weapon to either a gun or a melee weapon

3rd game:The studio of melt down
The only goal is to find 5 keys with your 5 teammates if you don't make it in time then let's just say... Errr lava falls on you

4th game idea:
It will be a sacrifice of time you have 10 teammates get all numbers"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12" for the clock once you've done only one person gets to sacrifice 4 people or either you'd vote your self, if you lost time with your teams of 10 you all will be squished by a stick from a clock

Deaths for season 2:
Guard shoots you and you fall in the ocean
