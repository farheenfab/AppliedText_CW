Games i would LOVE to see in Season 2:

Floor is lava.
The guards release hot lava onto the floor. people need to stand on something to save themselves. The lava goes higher and higher until it reaches 40 feet.

Hot Potato:
You have to pass the bomb to someone else while there is a 10 second cowntdown. when it reaches 0, the person holding the bomb will be blown up.

Parkour: You must jump on one surface to another to not fall down. If you fall down, you die from falling a specefic height.

Aim Practice: You must shoot the very very, *TINY* Target to pass. You will be given a bow and arrows (10) if you do not shoot the target, You will be shot.

Peice Hunt: You must *Hunt down 3 Rabbits*, find a Sword, and Iron Armour peices for the next round

*1 day before the next round the last 3 people eat 1 cooked rabbit each, then go to sleep*

Then they are forced to fight themselves on a Gladiator Arena. They fight eachother. one slips on a stone and one is about to kill him. But then another one
 kills the one who is about to kill the man who slipped. The last 2 object to fight and one says, *”Kill me… Im very tired. I regret coming here and my family 
hates me.”* But he cannot do it because he was kind, so then the tired man killed himself. Saddest. Ending. Ever…
