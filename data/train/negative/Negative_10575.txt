The thing which disturbs me in this series is the deaths of people.
The creator of this series build up a specific character of every player and not even that, they attached us with emotions of the players. Death of that depressed girl in that marble game is truly heartbreaking, Ali died due to betrayal and also of Seong's mother's death was depressing.
This series contains too much violation but yet people watch because this is something else.
Awesome
