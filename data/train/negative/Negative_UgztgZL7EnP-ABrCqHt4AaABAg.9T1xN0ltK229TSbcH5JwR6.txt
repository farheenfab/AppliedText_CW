As a society, we seem to have unhealthy  obsession with the culture of death, and it's pretty sick, otherwise shows like this, no matter how gripping or entertaining it is, would be repulsive to us.

Else, why is it that we would find it entertaining, the concept of the Elite putting together games of contest together for the purpose of us murdering each other? 

It's not like it's exactly original. The 1924 short story The Most Dangerous Game is about a Russian aristocrat who captures people, releases them in the wilderness, and hunts them for sport; The 1994 movie Surviving the Game is about a homeless guy who gets offered a “job” only to end up in a remote location and to become the prey in a hunting game played by rich and powerful people. More recently, the Hunger Games trilogy is all about poor people killing each other under the watchful eyes of the Elite.

If people see this as harmless, mindless entertainment, so can't see how it's desensitizing us to violence and death, and ideas of depopulation, then God help us all.
