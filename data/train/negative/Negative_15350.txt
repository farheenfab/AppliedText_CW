This concept trailer has so many questions, but the thing is Teaser PRO took this from "Animal World", the main character sees himself as a clown and fight monsters and he participate in a rock paper scissor game to win money to pay his crush bill from her mother illness and if he loses he becomes a slave.

Yeah,it's much more confusing.
