My top fav characters of SquidGame:
1- Han Mi-nyeo (the crazy woman)
2-  Sae-byeok  (the pretty girl)
3- Gi Hun (the main guy)
I don’t like sang woo, he is overrated i feel. And I mean the character, not the actor. If I had to play these game I would, but I wouldn’t kill anyone physically myself or betray anyone.
