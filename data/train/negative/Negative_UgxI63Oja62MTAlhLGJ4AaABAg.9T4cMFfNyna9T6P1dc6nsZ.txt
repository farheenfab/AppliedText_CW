from the first game when the doll see you you'll die and many people got frighten so they run and many of them died(SAD:( , the second game shapes bisquit they need to shape a bisquit before they'l die they have to use a needle to do it if the bisquit brakes they die iin that scene descent people died, 3rd game it was the marble game that was very challenging game, 4rth game tug of war they did that at the highest building if the team lose theyll be fall to their death 5th gamethey try to cross a galss bridge one of them is real glass and one of them not, half of the people died and the remaining is 3, they have a fancy dinner and the girl died because that 1 guy killed her, LAST game squid game the guy at neck of the squid must ddefend and the guy from the tail must attack and he won the game 1 year later he was called by the bank officials and they were shocked the he has a 42 billion and the guy who just won doesn't seem to care he's depressed and he went to a building were he met an old man he was his team and the guy was angry because he know all about the game he died at the right time, at the end the guy saw a player beside the train playing with the business looking man and realised he was like that long ago so he went there to stop the man  who who look like a businessman   and it was too late he went in the train and left, but he took the card to a man who was given to the bussiness looking man and he called that number but the caller knows who he is and they said ride on that plane for his own good, but he did not get in the plane and walking at the end and also he has a red hair. My opinion there was many plot hole in the movie many confusing scene and Idk why theres no back up to the agent police man who was shot at the edge of the island I give a 0 rating awfull movie, not recommended.
