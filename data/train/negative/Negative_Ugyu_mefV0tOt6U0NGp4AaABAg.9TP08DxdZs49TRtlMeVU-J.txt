@@Hi.Im.Lovely well she didn't die from the glass walking game but SHE was going to die because of the glass game, if sang woo didn't kill her then she would've died from blood loss or from when they did the fight at the end since she lost so much blood she was in no shape to fight, so either way she would've died.
