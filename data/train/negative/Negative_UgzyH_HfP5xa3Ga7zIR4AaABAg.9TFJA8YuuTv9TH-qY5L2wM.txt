 Unfortunately, I do understand where you’re coming from…it’s not always like that. Speaking for myself,  I’m not like that and I know women that are not like this also. There are many bad apples out there and I can’t speak for them but nobody (man or woman) is perfect and it might be beneficial for you to aim towards finding a balanced point of view on that matter. It’s not always black and white and taking the time to open-mindedly learn the other sides POV and trying to understand why they act this way could really help balance your views on women. I’m sorry if you’ve experienced pain, hurt, or unfair treatment from women in your past, I don’t think anybody deserves to feel this way and those feelings almost always pile up and manifest into anger, rage, and opposition… hopefully I didn’t upset you and you see this as an olive branch
