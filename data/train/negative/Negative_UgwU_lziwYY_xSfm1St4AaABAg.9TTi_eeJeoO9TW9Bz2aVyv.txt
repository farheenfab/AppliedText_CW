 it’s not about identity. They were BORN non binary. It’s not your place to deny science when it has been proven time and time again that being trans and non binary is real and valid. You’re just stuck in the past and can’t handle that times are changing. I can provide several sources (in theory, but in practice yt doesn’t let people post links lol) proving that non binary and trans people do in fact exist, YOU can’t. And once again, do not call it an “identity.” Being trans is not an “identity” i get to take on and off. It’s who I am. I don’t “identify” as non binary, I AM non binary and always have been. I don’t think ANYONE deserves to be “jailed,” as prison is just legal slavery, but the people like you who commit discrimination and hate crimes definitely need therapy, proper education and SAFE rehabilitation.
