Idk I wasn't really enjoying Alice in Borderland I feel like they were trying so hard to have iconic characters and their behavior seemed weird. I love anime and manga but when Japan make movies that is based on anime,,,, I can’t with those wigs and acting  It’s kinda boring and the quality is not that good. Personally I prefer Squid Game. Squid Game has more details and I like how they film.
