-su7uu5ix3z stop being jealous just because modern Korean drama contents have reached the level that Japanese ones failed to. You are only saying that because you are Japanese and hateful and jealous of anything from Korea. I watched both Kaiji and this show but they are worlds apart different. Kaiji merely focuses on the game strategies. In Squid game, games are only secondary - they are childrenâ€™s game, easy and simple. It is the overarching human drama of Squid Game that truly captivates the audience, which most Japanese movies/dramas fail to do because their actors cannot act and they always go into preaching mode about human existence like a sermon, very cringy.
