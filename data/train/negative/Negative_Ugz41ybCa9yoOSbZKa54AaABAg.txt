I'm supposed to believe that these contestants would just stay perfectly in place as the doll picks them off one by one? Flight or fight response would take place regardless of what the rules of the game is. Watch these people run around 1:27 mark, especially the long haired woman -  they act as if they're being chased by a character in an amusement park horror maze.

This scene should convey a sense of frightening pandemonium. Why this show is a hit, I'll never know. The Dalgona game was equally lame and improbable.
