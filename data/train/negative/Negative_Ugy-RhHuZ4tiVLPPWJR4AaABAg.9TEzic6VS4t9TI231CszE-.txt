@@Wayzerr I just think there’s too many things that don’t rly make sense to make it “the best show I’ve ever seen” yk? Like why would that police officer do what he did without telling anyone beforehand? The American vips are legit so cringe. Also if more than 100 people left the game, why didn’t they report it to the police? We only see one person report which is stupid like u just watched and participated in a game of red light green light where there were guns on the wall and over 200 people died. Why wouldn’t you report? The officers only called bullshit because well it sounds ridiculous but if 100+ people reported wouldn’t they start investigating?
