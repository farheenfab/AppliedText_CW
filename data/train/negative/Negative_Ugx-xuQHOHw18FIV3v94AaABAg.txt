This show was crazy, the twists and turns and the part where they actually practised free will to take part showing the reality of life for most people... and the old man (no spoilers) but wow... the symbolism and comparison to the horses, the first and last player dynamic and VIPs... showed so many realities of our world of how the filthy rich exploit the poor. :( really sad and disturbing at times but definitely worth the watch
