A lot of terrible and nihilistic viewpoints here. History is full of people banding together during crisis moments and supporting one another. I'm not so full of myself that I would ever claim to know what human nature is, but we are very obviously not purely selfish creatures. 
A lot of the inhumane things acts committed in this show are committed by people in desperate circumstances and in dire fear for their lives. The cruel organization holding the, 'games' have to work to condition their victims to behave that way.
