And i wondered why he's so good at playing psychopaths. This makes things a lot clearer. I just couldn't belive that he actually said that. I almost stopped breathing for a second.,and I was literary shaking. I'm still shocked and I can't belive. Sang Woo is the most horrible person in Squid game, and one of the worst fictional characters ever !  Outside of the game, he was a criminal wanted by the police for financial crimes. He put up his own mom's house and bussines as a collateral !. In the game, he did everything just to save himself, including killing three people in cold blood !  He was villing to kill his childhood friend !  He betrayed everyone who considered him a friend and trusted him. He was a liar, manipulator, cunning, calculating, two faced, narcistic, and just a horrible, horrible human beings. He had all the traits of of psychopath /sociopath. People who keep on defending him, try to justify and rationalise his disgusting behaviour and even admire him, arent any better than him. They are the same as he is and they can't be trusted. I was so shocked when Wi ha joon said that, because he seamed like a genuine and nice person. Stupid me. I still haven't learned. I watched some of his movies and dramas. I thought he was a good actor.  I have seen a few episodes of "Romance is a bonus book", but I'm going to stop now. I dont care for Wi ha Joon anymore.!   I have NO respect for him anymore. To hell with him !  And just for the record, I HATE everyone who doesn't hate Sang woo !
