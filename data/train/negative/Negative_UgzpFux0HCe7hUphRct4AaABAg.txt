The only people who are getting the best and realest experience are those who actually speak and understand Korean lol so idk why we are fighting over dubbed vs subtitles. Because guess what, even though you watch it with subtitles, you are still relying on the translation to be accurate. There might be Korean speakers who say the English translation is terrible and doesn't capture exactly what they say. So just let people watch the show however they want to watch it. When you watch it dubbed, yes sure it doesn't match the emotion of the original but you can also still read their faces and see what they are trying to convey even if it doesn't match up perfectly. But unless you speak Korean and understand it, just shut up and let people watch it how they want because none of us are getting the authentic experience except ppl who understand the language.
