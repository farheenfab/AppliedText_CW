@@nevenamitrovic2569 I disagree. Other shows and movies have dealt with similar situations without using excessive blood (the Hunger Games movies for example). The visible blood does up the horror factor Squid Game has, but I don't think the value of the show would deteriorate much without it. The violence and dark themes would still be present, same with the drama and storyline. (This is just my opinion- not trying to sound rude here or force it on you. Sorry if it seems like that, it's hard to convey tone of voice through text).
