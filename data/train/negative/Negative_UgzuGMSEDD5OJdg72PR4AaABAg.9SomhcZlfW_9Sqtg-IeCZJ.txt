 Canada is not a homogeneous country. There are non whites in Canada, so Canada as a location cannot define one's identity. You know Japanese can live outside of Japan right? For you to be half Chinese, one of your parents had to move to another place. So location doesn't determine identity. Now to respond to your claim, I also don't think there is any white person who would upload videos in Japanese without translation and make many comments demonizing Koreans. I clicked on her picture and was able to see some of her previous comments on this page, all negative and centered around Koreans. I saw a comment, in which she claimed Koreans copy from Japanese and Chinese. I went on her page, I saw Japanese and Chinese content and two English videos who are about Koreans. According to my logic she is definitely not white.
