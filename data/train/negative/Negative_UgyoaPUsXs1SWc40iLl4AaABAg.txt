This series just shows what money can do to people, how humans can get so greedy, how a friend can betray you in an instant for the sake of money and the most important one like Mahatma Gandhi once said: “You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty”. 
As bad as things might sometimes seem, there is so much good in the world. 

Definitely a must watch!!
