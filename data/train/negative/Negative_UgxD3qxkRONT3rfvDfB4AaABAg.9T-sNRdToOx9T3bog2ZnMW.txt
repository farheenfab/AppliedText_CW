@@Hello___________ even the background character 68& 69 upsets me. I imagine the shy and quiet wife sacrificed herself for her husband to live since she knows that she won't survive the other games

But it upset me more that 69 commit die. if he was going to die just like that he could have given the marble to Sae-byok's gf or Ali
