Lee Jung Jae always looked so classy and elegant whenever I saw him in his previous works.. The way he speaks and dresses.. Which is why the first time I saw Squid Game with no proper knowledge of the series I was in disbelief looking at his character.. Like he genuinely looks like a homeless dude..  Props to the make up team.
