I wonder why the music director wasn't there? He should've been part of it and sitting with them too because honestly, I love the background music just as much as I love the production set. I'm intrigued by it. I wanted to know more about his music choices in the series. I want to see and hear him talk about what went on with creating the background music in a particular scene in the episode and why. It would have been also an immersive commentary session with the actors and directors in it.
