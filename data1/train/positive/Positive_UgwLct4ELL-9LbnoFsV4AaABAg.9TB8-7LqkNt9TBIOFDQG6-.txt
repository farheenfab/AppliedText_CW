I feel the same! Why did the other actors got direct questions when she just “answered” a question that wasn’t directed to anyone in particular. I mean, I know there are scripts which they have to go off and someone probably wrote it like that with a reason clearly good enough to actually get produced but I still feel upset about it on a very personal level.
