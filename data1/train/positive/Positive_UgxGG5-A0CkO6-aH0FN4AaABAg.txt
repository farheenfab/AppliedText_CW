Is just me or, Jimmy is boring and his laugh is fake? I can understand that it isn’t that easy to talk with people so culturally different and even physically distant from you, but come on! As a host you should entertain, and be able to, in the first place, involve them and put them at ease if they appear shy or just feel themselves like out of place. This is a huge thing for them and dealing with all this sudden and global attention can be overwhelming and difficult to handle. Jimmy hasn’t been empathetic, but only fake and concentrated on the show and about saying the right thing. He looks neither that charismatic.
