 There are actually a lot of them? Try Signal (mystery/crime) or Misaeng (hyperrealistic view into the corporatist culture in korea) or Hell is Other People (psycho thriller). And if you want super realism, try D.P (Deserter Pursuit). Plenty of actors in these shows are average koreans, especially those who play the cops.
