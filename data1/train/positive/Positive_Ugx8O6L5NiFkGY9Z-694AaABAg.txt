Let me appreciate Park Hae Soo (the one who played the antagonist role Sangwoo) . He portrayed it so well (the laid back, smart yet cunning character) I've been rooting for him even he was the villain. Park Hae Seo is such a brilliant and versatile actor. I watched Prison Playbook and he is a total dumbas$ and funny there  so different from his role as Sangwoo
