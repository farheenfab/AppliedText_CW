 In terms of the new thumbnail, MrBeast looks a lot better, and it embraces the meme.
However, Iâ€™m not sold on Gi-Hun.
The lighting in his face makes him stand out in a distracting way, and the rage on his face seems a bit odd as well given his character. I think his smiling shot from the original thumbnail was more fitting.
The cookie is a nice touch though.
Still, I would say that the new thumbnail is better overall.
