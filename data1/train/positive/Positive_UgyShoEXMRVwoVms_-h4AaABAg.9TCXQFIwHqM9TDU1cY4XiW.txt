 Crash landing on you is also another k-drama sensation. It describes North Korea quite accurately about how they live, etc since the series were written by interviewing North Korean defectors in the South. Its basically love story but a lot of things going on. You will laugh and cry at the same time. If you want to feel the emotional riding again. Check out this one. Just watch episode 1,2 and if you are not hooked then its not for you. Of course watch sub, not dub.
