 Yup Yup. Unless they have big, loyal fanbases(so, either neckbeards or lots of fangirls lol), "big name" actors\actresses have 0 pull on audiences, doesn't matter how popular they seem to be on social networks or talk shows.
Streaming services have opened so many options for viewers that people started opening their minds to series\movies with unknown or less known actors\actresses a while ago, and now it's the norm. 
I love it
