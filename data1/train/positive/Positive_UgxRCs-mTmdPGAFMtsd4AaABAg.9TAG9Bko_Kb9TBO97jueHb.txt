 his daughter knows who her bio father and her step father is, but Gi Hun has kinda neclected her because he's busy with helping other people but his family. When his wife gave birth to her, he was with his dying friend. He has never tried hard enough for her. So he is a man with good heart, but in his family's perspective, he's never been there for them (he even use his mom's insurance which is a reason she can't get treated)
