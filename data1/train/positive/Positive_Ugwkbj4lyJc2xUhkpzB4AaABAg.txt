When he enters his "house" during the marbles game, there is a triangle/square/circle panel hanging outside the door (around 52 minutes in ep6). But I knew right away when they showed that in the records the "number 1" file was missing; from there I enjoyed every bit of the character knowing he was the man behind all this. The transition from "dementia" to sharp mind, visible throughout the marble game, is just brilliant.
