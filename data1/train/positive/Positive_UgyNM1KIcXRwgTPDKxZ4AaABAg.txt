I was so damn impressed by this whole show. The writing, the acting, the decor. I fell in love with the pastel stair case right away, and I loved seeing it whenever it came on. These people really know how to act, and they’re not afraid to be animated or “ugly” and that makes the whole difference. Especially Il-nam and the “”crazy”” woman (sorry I forgot her name)
