Hoyeon's performance was outstanding!! she said in an interview that she and two other girl co-stars would take long walks after filming just to talk. In she said she would cry to them because she didn't think her acting was good, but they would comfort her. Literally biggest imposter syndrome because i would of never guess it was her first time acting
