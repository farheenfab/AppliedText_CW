Lol no, the triangle is NOT harder than stars. I’m Korean and I’ve played that so many times as a kid and triangle is extremely straight forward where u just have a straight long line with no cuts, no a lot of edges and it’s literally 3 straight lines. Star on the other hand has A LOT more edges and have many turns. Square is triangle but 4 lines, umbrella is self explanatory, and circle is also hard since it’s not straight lines but u have to constantly change angles as u go around. Think of it like this, can u draw a perfect circle easily? Can u draw a square or triangle easily? Can u draw a perfect star easily? Same thing
