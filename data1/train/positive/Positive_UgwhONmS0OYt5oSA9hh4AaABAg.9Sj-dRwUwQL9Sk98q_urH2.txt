Actually I loved that plot twist, when they started voting I really though _"OK, so the majority will vote to stay and that's it, so predictable..."_ so I was completely caught off guard when _"Nope, they are actually getting back to their normal lives"_ and they showed us why most of them ended up choosing to return, that was definitely a plus for me!
