 Someone's upset that their ideology happens to be a bogus fantasy. The concept of free market capitalism is even more predatory than crony capitalism. Libertarians, neo-mercantilists and conservatives are so determined to fetishize the abolishment of taxes and regulations, falsely hoping that it will make them wealthy, while completely lacking any realistic interpretation of historical events that have proven this to be completely false and moronic.
