.cbc92 delete your last word. you don't know the history of korean and japanese's relationship with each other. this topic is really sensitive so please respect about it.

and all of the shows are just for entertainment for fvck sake, no need to be sensitive. this is the entertainment, there is no such things as 'copycat' because apparently, the entertainment industry are always INSPIRED by each other. that's how it works. so yeah, be matured thinking.
