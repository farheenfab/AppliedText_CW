I missed it too. If there's a S2 I hope it goes down the rabbit hole of the organization rather than return to the island for a new set of games. I just think it would feel repetitive and lack tension that way (even if they use new games). Just hire better white actors and write better English dialogue, because anytime the VIPs spoke that was cringey af.
