 Again, we are talking about the decisions taken by the character (Il-nam) with respect to his fellow players.

It's not about the writer at all. 

When you bring the writers into it, it changes the discussion because now you have an omniscient entity involved.

It takes the discussion from “Why did this character do X” to “Why did the writer make the character do X” and there's a considerable difference between the two. Writers ofcourse make certain decisions to progress the plot forward and what not.. Character decisions are based on logic and reason pertaining to their personality.
