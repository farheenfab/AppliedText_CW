 Tk’s episode was interesting too because it was a different dynamic and facet of Nanno we haven’t seen. I wonder if it would be sustainable and with season 2 Nanno’s consciousness of certain methods.


Which also brings up Yuri, ( not shipping) a lot of people dislike her. Yet I enjoy comparison of methods and how they bring depth to each other. Not a competition
