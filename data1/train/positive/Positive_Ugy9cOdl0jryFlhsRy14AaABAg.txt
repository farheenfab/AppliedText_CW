This series is an intensely good film. Korean movies dont disappoint  A lot of wisdom and betrayal happened in this film. I cried and the true character of a person will reveal at the moment of crucial situation. May be brutal but the concept of this film is laudable. It tackles the complexity of human nature, anyone is capable of doing evil no matter who u are, but integrity wins when u are no longer bounded  by desperate human needs... In the end,  a nice red hair is only what u need.   haha.
