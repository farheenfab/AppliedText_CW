All of those shows you listed were mehh I stopped borderland halfway, there's a reason why squidgame is surpassing these shows by a ball park & that's because it's actually GOOD & has GREAT character development. The concept isn't new but this show actually does it well & executes it to actually enjoy & fall for the characters.
