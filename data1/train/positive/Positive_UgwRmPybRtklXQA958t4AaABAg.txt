I’ve been watching kdramas for almost 3 years now, and I’ve been observing how Korea, their language and culture becomes more and more popular across the world. This show is none like any of the other kdramas I’ve seen, and they deserve all praise they get, but I also hope that because of this show the world will discover many other kdramas and actors / actresses, because there’s so many good productions to see!
