 Hyungnim and Hyung are different. Hyungnim is a polite way to call someone close and older than you as a male. And here we have to say politely with people that we don’t know well so Sang-Woo wanted to make Ali feel comfortable so He let Ali call “Hyung”. bc Ali kept calling him “Sajangnim” which means “an owner, a Chief of company”. And this “Sajangnim” word also means that those foreign workers they say this word a lot and that also shows the way they learnt Korean from their workplaces. Kinda bitter. 
Anyway, Sangwoo didn’t want Ali to keep calling him “Sajangnim” bc it’s way too polite. So He just wanted to Ali call him in a more casual way. Yes you get close when you call someone like this but that’s not like a special thing.
