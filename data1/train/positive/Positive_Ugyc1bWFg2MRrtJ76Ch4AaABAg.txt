It's crazy how whenever i used to tell people i watched kdramas, they always used to say that they were cringe and my choices sucked and now these very people are the ones going crazy after Squid Game ,which mind you, is a K drama. Proud to see these actors come so far. I have been following JUng jae since the beginnings of his career and am so proud to see him come so far.
