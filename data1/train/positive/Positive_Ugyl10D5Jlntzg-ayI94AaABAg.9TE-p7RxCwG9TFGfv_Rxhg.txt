Honestly there will always be two sides. From what I know in western countries there are less people who watch Korean stuff but in Vietnam actually everyone does and you're not weird here for doing so. So if watching Korean movies will become normal in western countries then I am sure you will have no problem!

I hope you'll keep watching no matter what anyone says! You know what is fun for you don't make others dictate what you should or not watch :))
