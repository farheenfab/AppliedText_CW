 â€‹I literally told you I am a Centrist and don't subscribe to any specific political identity. Lol. America is not the laughing stock of the world, you are brainwashed to believe that by media. A lot of people want to migrate here. I don't even understand your point at this point. You think that every country is perfect except the US or something? Obviously it has flaws but it's much much better to live here than most other countries in the world.
