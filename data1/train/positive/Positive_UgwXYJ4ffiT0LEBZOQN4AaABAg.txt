The fact that Gi-Un always end up last on every game (except for the tug of war) means that he’s the last person to witness the wrong and the messed up concept on winning the game. He’s always last to finish the games and end up being the only one to win the game. 

And with the ending, it’s so incredible because before Il-nam passes away, Gi-Un said that if he wins the bet, he’ll kill Il-nam himself. But if you remember, Gi-Un NEVER killed anyone in the game, he’s always so trustful and helpful to everyone that he has never killed anyone before to survive, and knowing this, Il-nam places the bet and passed away on his own so that Gi-Un doesn’t have to kill him and get his hands dirty. 

Lastly, placing the bet, Il-nam KNEW he would lose that’s why he placed such bet, he KNEW that Gi-Un would still trust people that’s why he kept on asking for verbal confirmation, and the fact that Gi-Un never took his eyes off the homeless man proved his point because in the end, the homeless man was saved, and if you noticed, it kind of connects to how Gi-Un always manage to stay alive in the LAST seconds, same with the homeless man, he was saved at the last minute. 

Gi-Un, of course wasnt much of the greatest and kindest people in the game, but he was the ONLY ONE to ever talk to Il-nam in the game despite him being so old and having a tumor, Gi-Un was kind, the kindest person to Il-Nam that’s why he likes Gi-Un so much. Hence why he trusted and gave away his life to Gi-Un. 

It’s a very beautiful ending I think.
