Trying to figure out why South Korean culture and cinema are so in vogue right now because honestly in my opinion most of it is hot garbage as far as their cinema goes. Parasite is probably the best piece to come out of this wave and even that was way overblown by how amazing it was. If parasite was an original movie from the states with American actors it wouldâ€™ve been a hella generic horror movie.
