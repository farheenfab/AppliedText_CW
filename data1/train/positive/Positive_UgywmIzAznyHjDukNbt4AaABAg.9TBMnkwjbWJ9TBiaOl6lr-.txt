Everyone calls u cringe because most of you people over obsess over sexualize everything that has to do with any character. Can we just enjoy a Korean show or a foreign show without people being fucking weirdos and shipping certain characters and unnecessarily sexualizing characters?? Im not saying this doesnâ€™t happen with American shows or movies, but its WAY more prominent when it comes to foreign shows and movies.
