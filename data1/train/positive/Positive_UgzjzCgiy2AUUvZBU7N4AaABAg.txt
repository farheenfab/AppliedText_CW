The art director absolutely knocked it out of the park.

Don't get me wrong, the acting, writing, and directing were all incredible. The series was an overall masterpiece. But the visual style was the absolute PERFECT balance between incredibly dark themes and whimsical visuals. It tricked your brain in a very odd way into thinking you were watching something cheery and lighthearted, only to be hit with something macabre and evil.

Brilliant job.
