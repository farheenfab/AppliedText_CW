 He probably join the game for fun and accept his death if that happen tbh (since he didn't show up at the VIP and only showed in his deathbed), all the clue above is just theory anyway. For all we know he also could have played the game fair and square and give Gi-hun the marble because he like Gi-hun a lot (since Gi-hun the only care for him)
