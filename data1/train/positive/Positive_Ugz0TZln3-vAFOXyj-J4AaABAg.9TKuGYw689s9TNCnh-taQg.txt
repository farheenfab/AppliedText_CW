I’ve heard that theory and it’s fun but I don’t think it makes sense - the guards all seem like highly regimented soldier-type recruits from the start. They don’t seem like the desperate rag tag bunch that make up the contestants.
Also there don’t appear to be any female guards or old guards - all seem like young athletic men.
