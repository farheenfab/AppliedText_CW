From seeing him in other movies and mainly hearing what his fellow actors say in interviews, Lee Jungjae is quite a method actor. IDK if he'd describe himself as one but everyone says he is really into his character. He is also kind of a serious person himself but at the same time really sweet, you could look up some interviews.
