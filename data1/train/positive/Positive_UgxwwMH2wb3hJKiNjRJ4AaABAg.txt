When 456 picked 001 as his partner, I believe 001 was actually surprised and extremely moved that anyone would choose him to play an unknown game where having a weak partner could potentially get you killed.

Based on the fact that he doesn't have any family or friends on his deathbed, it's possible his own family and children are eagerly waiting for him to die ASAP so they can inherit his fortune (or he might not have any family).

He didn't want to kill the only person who's shown him true and pure compassion for a very long time so let 456 win the marble game.
