 The irony is that Lee Jung Jae aka 456 has always been that way. New viewers only know him as a dork in Squid Game, but he is an old school top tier actor and model who is as famous as Lee Byung Hun, Jang Dong Gun, and Jung Woo Sung. He always played alpha male characters in films, so it was really surprising for the Korean audience to see him in a dorky role in Squid Game. If you see all his old films, you'll know what I mean.
