-wy3id7op5t Ahh I don't really mind that, but maybe because I don't know these actors since I'm not too familair with korean actors yet. It'd probably feel a bit weird to me too if I saw that with actors I know. I do like this though, they were given the opportunity and they did an amazing job. I would've never guessed this was their first acting job or first big acting job.
