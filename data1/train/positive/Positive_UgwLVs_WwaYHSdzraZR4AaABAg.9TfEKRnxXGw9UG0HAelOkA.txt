 Totally, I hear you on that. But also, I think the translators didn't necessarily expect the series to take off like that. I think some of the nuances in Korean culture get lost on the international audience, and they didn't put that much effort into conveying that. 

But perhaps...with the popularity of Korean media, some of the cultural nuances might be better appreciated by the international audience, and moving forward, translators might put more effort into conveying those cultural tidbits.
