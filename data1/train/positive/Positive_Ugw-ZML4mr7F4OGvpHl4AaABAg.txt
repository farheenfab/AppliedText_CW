Squid Game and many other shows that were also hard to see the light of day are the perfect example of how the movie industry and art industry in general, shouldn’t close their eyes and only going for stuff that without doubts will give them money. There’s so many talented people out there that can do amazing stuff and are always shut down cause “who are they?!”. That’s why I like how Netflix is coming to every country and giving everyone a chance to succeed..
