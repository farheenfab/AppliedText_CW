Ngl, I started watching cause Jennie was thanked in the ending credits, for showing support to Hoyeon (Kang Sae-byeok) during the filming, and I don't regret doing it cause this is one of the best shows I've watched in my whole life. The production is insane, and the actors are amazing. This show deserves all the recognition that is getting.
