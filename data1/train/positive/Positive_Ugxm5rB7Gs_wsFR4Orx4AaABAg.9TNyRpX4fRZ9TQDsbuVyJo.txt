 see I just thought he was like "fuck it" because of his brain tumour- you can have involuntary facial movements with that kind of thing (I knew someone who smiled near constantly after a stroke) and also he started running first because he knew he was terminal anyway so he may as well try win! Plus the time limit with someone with poor mobility would be an incentive to not dawdle...
Its so obvious looking back but if you know about brain tumours it's actually pretty explainable- total plot twist for me. Also don't be mean to people it's not very nice
