 exactly. There were lots of GREAT Korean movies in the early 00s. Unfortunately the western world wasn't interested in Korea at the time. People saying that the K-wave quality is just a recent phenomenon are just missing out. There are also top-tier quality movies and series from other countries, but since they're not as popular, we're missing out about them too. Brazil's "tropa de elite" is one the best action/drama movie ever. Japan's "audition" one of my favourite thriller/horror movies. And the list goes on.
