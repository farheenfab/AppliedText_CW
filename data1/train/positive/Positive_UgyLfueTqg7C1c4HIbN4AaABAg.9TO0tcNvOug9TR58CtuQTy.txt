Thanks for the props to Korean ppl (as a Korean I appreciate it) but most of the Korean ppl don't speak English as well as the majority of Indian ppl do. Also in Korea ppl kinda give you respect and envy for the ppl who speak fluent English cuz most of them can't, hey speaking multiple different language is a plus, not a minus.
