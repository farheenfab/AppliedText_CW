This show was AMAZING!!! I was heated about the ending but I’m hoping there’s payoff with season 2, if there is one. I am happy with just this season. Lawd, they are killing it in Korea! I wish they would’ve talked to the actor who played Ali. I loved how he was the only character who was a genuinely good person
