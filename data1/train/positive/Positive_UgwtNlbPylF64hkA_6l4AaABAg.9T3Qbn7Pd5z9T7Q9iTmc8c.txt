 I really am confused about your response to OP's comment. They were saying it was a smart long-play for Il-nam to choose to end the game as the last vote (in the button voting) in order to let the players see how miserable their lives are- to give them a chance to live their horrible lives if they choose. But in the end, the players themselves come back on their own volition. It was good writing and a genius ploy to place grandpa in the morally grey area.
