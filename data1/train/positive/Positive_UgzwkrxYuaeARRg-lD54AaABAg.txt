Also I noticed something about his Korean name:  il-nam could be a reference to his role as a character, since  'il' means One, and  'nam' means Man
So I think it could also be a fun reference to the fact that he is the player 1, but also his role as the creator of this game, meaning he is the "number 1 man"

By the way, this is just what I thought when I thought about his name, it's not necessarily what it means, in Korean the same word can have many different meanings
