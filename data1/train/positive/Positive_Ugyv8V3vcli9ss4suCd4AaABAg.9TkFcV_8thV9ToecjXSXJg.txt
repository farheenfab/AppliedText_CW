 there are quite some hints. For example, the old man askes the main character if it is the 24th cuz then it would be almost his sonâ€™s birthday. The birthday of the main character is on the 26th. Another hint is the old man saying that the main character looks like he got hit a lot, just like his son. There are a couple more, but overall it is just a theory
