Lee Jungjae, the main character in squid game, is one of the most well known and beloved top actors in Korea. He's been in the industry over 35 years. He played this below average loser character for the first time in squid game, but he normally plays a very charming, charismatic, or evil character in movies. I was actually quite shocked to see him playing such a loser character in.squid game because I was only used to seeing him playing strong, charismatic characters in movies. He did an amazing job though
