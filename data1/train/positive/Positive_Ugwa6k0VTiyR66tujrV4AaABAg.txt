As a kdrama enthusiast, I feel SO proud and happy that a kdrama is getting the recognition it deserves. Squid Game definitely proves that "kdramas" doesn't always mean the typical rom-com dramas but also dark-thrillers. I know every kdrama fans are feeling the same <3

Also there are some other dramas that deserves the same recognition like, Kingdom, Extracurriculars, D.P., Mouse etc,. If you like dark-thrillers, these dramas are highly recommended.
