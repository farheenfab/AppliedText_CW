Absolutely. I was consistently and constantly impressed by the stellar cinematography. It felt like I was part of an involved experience. I especially love the long, empty shots near the end of the show. To me, those shots symbolize the emptiness that the shattered mind of Gi-hun was left with after the games. The final shot of the last episode is one continuous scene that lasts for nearly 5 minutes, and I can't help but feel that every single second was so deliberate and so flawlessly executed. What a fantastic show.
