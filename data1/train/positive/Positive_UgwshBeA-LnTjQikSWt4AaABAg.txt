Can we take a moment to tell all those tiktokers who showed how easy the dalgona challenge is, to eat their words? Candy making is an art. You cannot just wing it and you certainly cannot make it so thick and think thats fair. i would love to see one person make a proper dalgona and actually finish the challenge saying how easy it was.
