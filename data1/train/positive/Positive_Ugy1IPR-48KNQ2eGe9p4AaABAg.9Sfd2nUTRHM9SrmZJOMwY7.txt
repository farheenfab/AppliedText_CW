 A lot of authors leave open endings in their books without the intention to ever make a sequel. The creator of Squid Game will probably make a sequel in the future since it was so popular, but I think the ending was pretty good. Open endings are meant to make you wonder what will happen. Whether there will be a sequel or not, I’m pretty satisfied with what we got. We’ll probably have to wait years to get word on a second season though.
