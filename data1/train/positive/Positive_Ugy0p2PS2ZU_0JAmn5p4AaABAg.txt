"Sang-woo thinks he came all the way here because he worked for it and because he's smart. Gi-un thinks the opposite, that it was the others who helped him cross the bridge. Winners exist because of the losers. Gi-un learned that from experience. But Sang-woo thinks he can only win by turning others into losers. I think the difference in beliefs is what makes this show stand out from other survival game shows."
