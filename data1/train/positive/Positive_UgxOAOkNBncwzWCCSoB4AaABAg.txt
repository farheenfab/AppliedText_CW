Thought this was going to be your average survival film I could just have on the in background. What I got was a 9 episode cult classic contender. Extremely well developed characters and some of the best acting I've seen in a long time. For this genre, I was not expecting to hate characters or care for others so deeply.... some scenes really hit deep. Like damn... and that's where the magic lies for Squid Game, this isn't your average Hollywood production where the spectacle is in the plot or overdramatic twists. Here the real entertainment is in watching the host's cynical world view play out on a very human level through the relationships that are created and destroyed between the characters. Make sure you watch it with subtitles, the native acting is too good to substitute.
