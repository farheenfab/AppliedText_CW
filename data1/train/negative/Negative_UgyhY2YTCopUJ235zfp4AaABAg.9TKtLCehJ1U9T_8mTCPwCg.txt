 they did need it though because otherwise there would be no sense as to how all of this money was gotten to make the games happen in the first place. The reason is VIPs give money to the game through bets, just like the horse races that the main character bets for at the start of the series. It makes the show more realistic to have VIPs because otherwise there would be no meaning as to how anyone has this much money to make this game happen every year.
