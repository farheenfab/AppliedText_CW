It's meant to be like that. They claim to be fair but very much are not. There's at least one player who doesn't have Korean as their first language and at least two who weren't raised in South Korea so don't know some of the games (and then there's Jiyeong who was in prison for who knows how long from who knows what age AND is also from a different generation). The Front Man was either lying through his mask or is just brainwashed by the host's mentality to actually believe those words to be true.

But yeah I got from the first game that it's meant to be a metaphor for capitalism. And human choices. Bc Sang-woo and Deok-su got what's coming to them, coming to them, but Ali and Sae-byeok didn't sign up for any of this (the outside world stuff at least).
