I doubt this theory because, when the FrontMan killed the staffs that were giving clues to the surgeon,

for betraying the games' principle of an 'even playing field' he said 
"I don't care if you want to sell or even eat the organs"

this shows that, doing those thing are inherently deemed uncouth by him (FrontMan), 
thus portraying to me that this game show is not down with cannibalization of its contestants as part of it, whereas more 'innocent' authentic childhood games structure are.
