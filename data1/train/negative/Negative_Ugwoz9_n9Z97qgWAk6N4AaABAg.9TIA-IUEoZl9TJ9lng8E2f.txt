  I think I'm sort of in two minds about that. Some of the games, yeah they didn't have to but in other parts they did.

Like making them play tug of war over a bridge so they literally pull an entire opposite team to their death. That's at their own hands. As well as making them choose partners to go one on one against. It has them making gross decisions to try and kill the other person - thank you marbles episode. Unless a person sacrifices themselves for you in some instances, I'd say overall, having to kill someone else is not entirely avoidable.
