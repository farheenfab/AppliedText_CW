 the ones who lived after ep 1 also didn’t have a choice and didn’t know “ eliminated “ means killed , but they survived . the people who died in ep 1 could just stop their panic and focus to win , the person who actually was a sacrifice for others ( to know it’s a death game ) was the first guy who died . the other ones knew what’s gonna happen if they move but they tried to escape . it’s not cute to be in that situation and i’d definitely panic ( people can do anything in life death situation bc the brain can’t think about consequences and would just focus on survival ) but they at least could’ve controlled themselves more and tried not to escape
