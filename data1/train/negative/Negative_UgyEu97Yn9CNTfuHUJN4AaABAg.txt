I was so frustrated that Gi-hun's fundamental flaws prevented him from having a happy ending  .... Man, just go to your daughter! Look after that boy, look after your friend's mama..! But no, he's not the type to analyze a problem and solve it over a long period of time. He only sees what's in front of him, whatever catches his attention or emotion, and runs after it. ADHD king. So frustrating to watch. It's good writing, but damn!
