I think it's a good Idea. After watching this vedio, the negativity of Squid game won't takeover on our kids. Yesterday I saw some childrens who were playing and saying Now you've to die. Then I thought there's something wrong with it. It's our responsibility that we take such kind of initiatives for our kids.
