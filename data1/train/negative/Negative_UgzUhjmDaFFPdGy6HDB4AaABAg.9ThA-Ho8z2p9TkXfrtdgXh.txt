Of course I don't " Know". But I think he was willing to play and die if it came to that, but the Marble Game, gave him a way out. If what we saw was as it really happened, there was no way he could guarantee a win in Tug of war (There are videos of him being locked in). They could have easily lost at Tug of war and he would have died. The Marble game, he could win or lose and not be shot. I get that, but after that it would have been life or death for every game.
