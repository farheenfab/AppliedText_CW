You're wrong, There isn't going to be a second series, South Korea's best actors all got killed off in the first series!

The only way there could be a sequel is if they set it in a completely different country. After all, one of the billionaires says "you Koreans are knocking it out of the park this year!" .. implying that this horrendous spectacle is not exclusive to Korea,
