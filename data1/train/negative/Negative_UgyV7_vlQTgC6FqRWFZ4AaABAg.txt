Funny how red light green light in English is seen as this random “RED LIGHT I CAUGHT YOU” situation whereas the Korean one is a song with lyrics where it turns around when the song ends. So you can time when to stop, since it’s the same thing being sung every time in the same timing. American version it gets more and more random meaning you’ll die easier.
