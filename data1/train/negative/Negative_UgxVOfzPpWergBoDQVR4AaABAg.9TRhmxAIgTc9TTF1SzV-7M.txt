Bruh did you guys not watch the show? It clearly shows in the final episode flashback scene that he was there when the VIPs arrived and the frontman approached him regarding the VIPs arrival, but then he says that watching the games just won't feel the same as actually having played in them and then he just leaves.

Also, I don't think the initial "plan" was for him to discreetly leave before the marble game by being the odd man out. The only reason there was an odd number of players was because the doctor got caught doing the organ harvesting thing right before the marble game and got killed, otherwise there would have been an even number of players. I highly doubt they planned to catch him right in time to kill him and make it an odd number of players before the marble game. I believe the plan was always to fake kill him during the marble game, he faked his dementia so that he could go into the closed off space where he said his "house" was so that no one would see him get "killed".
