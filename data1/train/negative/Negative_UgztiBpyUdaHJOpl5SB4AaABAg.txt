I really thought they didn't show his death in the marbles game, because the director thought it would be too crude to show the death of an old man point-blank, perhaps out of criticism or fear that the public would take it too obscene, they fooled me very well , and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who thought the same thing lmao.
