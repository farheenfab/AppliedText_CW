Park Hae-soo, who played Jo Sang-woo did one hell of a job playing an elitist in this show...there is a point here where the character and actor are split screened and its as if I am looking at two different people...he really looks different, no doubt with help from the production team but wow...the character is someone I wouldn't want to hang around with...the actor is someone I want to buy a beer for...lol.
