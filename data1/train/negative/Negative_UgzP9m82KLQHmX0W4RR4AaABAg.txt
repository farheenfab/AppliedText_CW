I also noticed that they never showed the old man's body when he was supposed to be "killed" after the marble game, the camera just pans out and blocks it with the fence, Gi-Hun's other teamates are shown otherwise: Ali and Ji-yeong on marble game, Cho on dinal game, sae-byeok on the bed, and others. They literally showed everyone except the old man.
