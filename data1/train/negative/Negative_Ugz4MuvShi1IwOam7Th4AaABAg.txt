Boss, regarding the dementia, one can't say the arena was on his previous home based on the information at the current episode; it being a hint. What was interesting, or the hint,  was how he "forgot" whether he said even or odd yet recalled losing the prior round with the marbles. There are different types of memory and different types of loss, forgetting ones name yet still being capable of speech for example. It was when he remembered he lost the match prior yet forgot if he said even or odd that it became suspicious.
