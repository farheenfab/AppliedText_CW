 Yup, I was expecting the beams holding the glass to go outward or something to make all the glass drop, but the exploding glass was cool I guess (not sure how it all exploded though)  but having shards of glass fly towards them all seemed quite stupid,  including that big fat piece that stuck her in the gut.   I thought this was supposed to be "fair" for everyone.
