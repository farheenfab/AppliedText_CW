The actors' circumstances, the tragedies, the images of working moms, the fear of debt, the love between families are shown in a way that isn't seedy or sensationalized but real and relatable to all people of all incomes and all cultural backgrounds...its universal and understandable for people of all ages too...which is why it worked.
