 that's true they didn't show it for ever single person that fell, but I'm p sure they did show a close up shot of the first guy to fall and I remember it being really gruesome with his skull cracked open oozing his brain. They should've have to show it for every single one bc that shows well enough the amount of damage that fall would cause. Unless I'm mixing it up with the tug of war but I don't think I am
