Maybe I'm hard of hearing, but you don't hear a thud of Ali's body after he's executed either.  I think a twist to Season 2 would be that Ali Abdul is now a soldier, VIP or some other high ranking member in the squid game.  Sang-woo lied/deceived Ali for the marbles.  Not sure that it counts as a legitimate marbles game to obtain them.  Yes, no physical violence was used, but deception can be interpreted as a form of mental/psychological violence.
