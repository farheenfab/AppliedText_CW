This series actually reminded me of Parasites and how it tries to tell the stories of social and financial struggles and that people might even become predators when they are in desperate need of money. Even if this is only a movie, it hurts to realize that there are thousands of people, who actually live like this in real life: struggling with money, losing their parents/siblings, having no one to care for them
