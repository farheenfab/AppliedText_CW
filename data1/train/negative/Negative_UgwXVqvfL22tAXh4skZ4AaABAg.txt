When no one chose Mi-Nyeo as a partner, it was revealed that they let her skip the marbles game. 

Maybe this is due to the organizers assuming no one would choose Il-Nam as a partner. He then could make a decision if he'll continue playing the next games (skip the marbles game) or be "killed" off-camera.
