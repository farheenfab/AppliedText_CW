Also when the Main Character has one marble left, the gun is immediately aimed at him and he have to show it. But when Ilnam has one left, the guard wasn't taking his aim even though Ilnam didn't show he has one more left. That's because the guard wasn't sure on how to kill ilnam with killing him. So Ilnam walk again to take him to his home and gave his marble to him so that the guard would know that he doesn't need to kill the main character and Ilnam let him won. He's so smart.
