 I felt seen. So much of today's pop culture focuses on being rich and famous, with financial struggles assigned only to the super-poor society pariahs, the homeless, the refugees. 
In reality however, many well educated people, with a decent social circle and a middle-class background constantly fall victim to debt traps and ruin their lives in the process.
Poverty is veiled in capitalistic societies. And the only way to escape it from within the system is to turn against your own.
