Fight, flight, or freeze (the human panic response) is very hard to control. Most likely, those who froze where people whose natural fear response is to freeze.

When we are afraid, activity in the frontal lobe (the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking) decreases and the activity in the amygdala (fear center) increases. This means that people in danger are often unable to act logically.
