I agree the marbles would have been his last game, but there was no way for him to know how many people would make it to that round, especially when the Dr got hung just before that game, which would have guaranteed him a partner?

But still, completely agree with the idea the marbles would be his last game as the glass hopscotch would have posed far too much of a risk
