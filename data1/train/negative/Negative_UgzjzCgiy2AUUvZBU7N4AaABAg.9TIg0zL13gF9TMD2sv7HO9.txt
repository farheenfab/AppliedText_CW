Isn't it the *exact* opposite way, though? You go into the show fully expecting to watch something messed-up because you know it's a survival game where people are killed, but the dissonance caused by the colorful and childlike aesthetics is what makes it all the more unsettling; it's constantly screaming at you, "For the ones in charge, this is just entertainment." Now that I think about it, the black coffin with the pink ribbon on it really sums up the show's entire art direction.
