 i wasn't just talking about giselle's mistake. They have tons of haters even before that. also giselle is being bullied idt that's how you hold someone accountable. And she apologized alr so maybe just leave her alone or unstan her if you don't wanna accept her apology don't stress yourself, just a suggestion
