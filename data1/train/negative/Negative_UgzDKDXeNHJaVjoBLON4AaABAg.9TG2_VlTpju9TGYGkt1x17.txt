Er, Korean movies may have been considered underrated in the 80s and 90s, but by the 2000s critics were falling all over them. In 2003 alone Memories of Murder and Oldboy came out for chrissakes, and theyâ€™re two of the most widely praised films ever, not just among Korean cinema, but everywhere. Stuff only accelerated from that point forward, to the point that releases from directors like Bong Joon-ho are hugely anticipated.
