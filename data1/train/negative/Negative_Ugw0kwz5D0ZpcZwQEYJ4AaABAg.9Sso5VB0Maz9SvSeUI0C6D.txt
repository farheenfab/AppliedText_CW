 as another comment mentioned, it's the same thing as assuming "twinkle twinkle little star" is a song only one character from an American show knows just because only that character sings it and mentioning it as something revealing to the plot. You say that it's not an important thing but this video is literally about clues and I think that one of the clues not being a clue at all is important enough.
