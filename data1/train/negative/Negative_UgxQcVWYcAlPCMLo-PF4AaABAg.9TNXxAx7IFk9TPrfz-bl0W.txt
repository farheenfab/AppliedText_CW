Winning past marbles leaves him with no way out. He cannot win the game cause thats unfair to the players. if he won bridge he would have to play squid and of course wouldn't win that against a younger player. The only point in the game which he can leave is marbles. That's why he runs down the timer and goes to find the most secluded location he can to lose and leave without anyone seeing him.He only wanted to experience the game, not win it.
