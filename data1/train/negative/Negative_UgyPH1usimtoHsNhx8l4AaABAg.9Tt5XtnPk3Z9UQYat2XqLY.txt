.y.8591 When I've been told that he was committing suicide, when I watched this scene while knowing that, it felt waaaaaayyy more disturbing to me. I first thought he was out of touch and just did whatever the heck he "wanted" without thinking properly by putting himself in a filled up bathtub and drinking.
