I literally started to cry during the scene where he was forgetting about them playing the game and talking about his family. It felt like a person really dealing with the effects of dementia. 

But when 456 got the card, I immediately felt like I was betrayed by the old man. Knowing what he did felt so wrong. Even though, yes he truly was going to die, and that did have me crying a little again, it still felt wrong that he did all that.
