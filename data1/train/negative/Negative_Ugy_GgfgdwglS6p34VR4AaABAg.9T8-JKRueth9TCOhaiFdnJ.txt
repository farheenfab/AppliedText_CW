He never really wanted to be a good father. His circumstances didn't stop him from being a good father before the game. He could have worked and not gambled his money to be a better father but he was selfish. So it didn't surprise me one bit when he turned around. He wasn't a good father and he never will be. He is still a selfish, self pitying as$ hole.
