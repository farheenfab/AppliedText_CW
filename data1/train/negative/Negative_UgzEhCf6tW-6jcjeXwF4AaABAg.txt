You forgot to mention smth.
Why did the old man decided to lose the marble game? Because the next game was "Glass bridge". So that means that old man who is the boss of the game could have died in that game. Thats why he choose to lose the marble game so that he can pretend to die infront of everyone.
On the other hand as you know Everyone wanted to know what would be the next game in the beginning till last,  But no one noticed that all the games were drawn on the wall where they were living.
