They’re so genuine and it really contrasts with Jimmy’s insincere and over-the-top persona. I’m tired of these big late night hosts acting so in awe of entertainment and missing the whole point. This show grew so quickly because it ridicules GREED and VANITY. It was beautiful. Why can’t Jimmy have a real conversation of depth?
