So far this has been the only show to ever stay on my mind for so long. Like the other ones with this genre were like Oh okay and I used to move on, but for this show, my mind was all over the place.. The constant replay of the death of the characters the plotline, the actors everything!!

Also the fact that  *most*  of these actors won't be in season 2
