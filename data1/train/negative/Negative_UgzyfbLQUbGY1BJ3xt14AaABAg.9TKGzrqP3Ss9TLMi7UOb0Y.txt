i do think he is very unlikeable though. but i'm of the opinion that just because he's the main character, doesn't mean he's the "best" character. he's clearly a flawed protagonist and his faults are honestly never resolved. but i think it's okay for movies/tv to do that sometimes, have imperfect characters. makes it feel more real.

 i was really expecting him to sacrifice himself for sae byeok at some point though, her death seemed the laziest to me, so random.
