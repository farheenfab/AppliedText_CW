 Let’s not overcomplicate and look at this at the wrong angle, it’s quite simple really. If he faked his death in the marble game, then it’s obvious he would’ve faked his death in all the previous games too if anything went wrong. Which means yeah, he cheated, and he never ever intended to die. Him not being afraid of death due to his tumour was what they initially wanted us to think, when he was still an innocent old man. But after the plot twist, we can see it’s very clear how selfish and hypocritical he is.
