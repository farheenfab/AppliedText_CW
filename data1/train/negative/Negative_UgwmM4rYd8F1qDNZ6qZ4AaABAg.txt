It actually came at the right time. Cause the fact that people were fed up with covid and was looking for a way to calm down and be happy led people to Kdramas and Kpop and of course series like squid game   (not everyone but most). Squid game really came about at the right time during this crisis! 
If you have really not watched it yet, We are telling ya u won't regret!! Go watch it!!! It's Damn AmaJin!!
