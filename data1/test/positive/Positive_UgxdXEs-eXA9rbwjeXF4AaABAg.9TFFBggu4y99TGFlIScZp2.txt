Yea I kinda didn't like anything Korean before and I thought kdrama was overrated. But once I finished squid game, I've gone on to watch sweet home, nevertheless, abyss and now I'm binge watching Dr. Romantic! I'm impressed with the quality content they put out and not to mention the acting is so exceptional to the point that it resonates with me. When they cry, I feel like crying. Also, most of their shows really highlight social issues with great detail.
