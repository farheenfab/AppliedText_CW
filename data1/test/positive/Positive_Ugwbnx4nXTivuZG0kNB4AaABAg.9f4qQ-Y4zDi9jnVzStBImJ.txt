 I disagree, because the triangle has three sides and three outer corners, making easy to cut this figure.

The circle on the other hand, it hasn't any straight line like the triangle, nor any outer corner to uses as reference, this figure only has a curved line, in that you must be careful when you are cutting it, thus making the circle harder than the triangle.
