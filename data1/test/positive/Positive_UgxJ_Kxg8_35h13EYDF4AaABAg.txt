It's almost like a weird dream sequence at the end.. when "Fly Me To The Moon" starts playing.. Idk how to describe the weird feeling that it gives me. You know how certain shows and movies, especially scenes can make you feel something like it affects you in a way.. I can tell that there was so much deep meaning that was brought into the making of this series..
