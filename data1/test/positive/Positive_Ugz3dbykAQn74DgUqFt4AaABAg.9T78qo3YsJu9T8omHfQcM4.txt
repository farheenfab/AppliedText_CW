 When they go back to the room with all the beds, it says there are 17 players left. Which means that there were 16 pairs and one left over (33 players in total), and if the doctor was still alive it would be 34.
In the sleeping room on the wall, there is the marble game depicted with three players. If the doctor was still alive, they would have the groups of 3 with one left over (anticipated to be Ilnam). Without the doctor, the 33 players could have all played in the groups of 3 as planned, but yet they went to into pairs with a player left. 
They wanted the player to be Ilnam; left out of the room of players and hence concealed from view, then they can make an evaluation of his health/ he could decide if he wanted to play. So there would be the option to give the explanation for leaving the player alive (the whole equal thing and no-one left out) or do what the players expected and kill the one left out.
