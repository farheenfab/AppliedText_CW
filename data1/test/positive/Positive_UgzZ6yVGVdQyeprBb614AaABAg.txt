I have to confess that I didn't spot him, really, it was a real plot twist for me.
I intuited that the Frontman has something to do with the cop, but as for Il-nam, I explained every odd behavior of his through his dementia and old age.
I felt from the beginning that there was something... "different" about him as a player, he was the #1, he was old and sick like no other player, but I thought that somehow he was there for a reason, meant by the organizers themselves, like a jolly, an easy opponent to defeat, or something.
