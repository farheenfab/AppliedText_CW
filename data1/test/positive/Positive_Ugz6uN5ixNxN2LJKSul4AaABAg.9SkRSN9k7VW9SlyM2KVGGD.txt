Knowing Korean (and east Asian in general) depictions of Americans, i don't necessarily think it was meant to sound strange and cringy. Korea is good at many things, but i very rarely find the English acting in Korean shows and movies very natural. Maybe it was intentional but it definitely wasn't my first thought
