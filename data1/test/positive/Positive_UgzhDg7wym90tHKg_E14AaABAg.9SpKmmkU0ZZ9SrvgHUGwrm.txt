To be honest, I am proud of him. While some people might feel he is a dumb, naive and/or boring person, I feel that he is showing the fact that there are good people in the world, even in a game that shows the cruelty of many human beings. I am really happy for someone with his character, even if he left too soon. I feel that it reflects reality because not every one would be like Sangwoo, to be honest.
