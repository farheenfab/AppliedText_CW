-kt9yq7iy9j From 2005 to 2015, korean shows were much more popular than Chinese in China. 

And your government banned kpop and kdrama and movie bcs of THAAD issue.

It is okay almost of korean understand the decision of china cause we did THAAD first and you guys just pay back.

But after banning korean series, these are still popular in China.

Then How come korean stole chinese show even though korean`s more popular than Chinese one in your country???
