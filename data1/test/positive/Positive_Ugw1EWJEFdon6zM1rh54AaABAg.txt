This show gave me some serious existential crisis. Feels like am myself in a huge debt, although am not but still you know you are and you feel like escaping this shitshow called reality and have some 'fun' playing games. It makes you doubt whether you still want to live in this world full of constant  pressure of collecting monetary things to prove your worth or just wait for Gong Yoo to approach you and play ddakji. 
Ngl at this point, I would be waiting for my card too.
