I am a Korean. I'm very happy that Korean dramas are known all over the world as squid games. The screenplay was produced by the director in 2008, but it was rejected because it did not match the times at that time. Therefore, it is not true that they plagiarized works from China and Japan. There are many exciting Korean dramas and movies such as squid games in Netflix Korea, so please watch them.
