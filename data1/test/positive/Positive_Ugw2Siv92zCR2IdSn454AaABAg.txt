People who are not much aware of Korean dramas and movies industry, Lee Jungjae (Gi-hun) does not really do much dramas as much as he does movies. He rarely does dramas that his last one was from 2 years ago, and all his projects are really worth watching! Superb acting and a very very versatile actor!
