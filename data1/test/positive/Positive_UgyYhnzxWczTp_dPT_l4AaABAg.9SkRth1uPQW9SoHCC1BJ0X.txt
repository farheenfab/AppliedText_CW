I think what you said is absolutely right!! And it’s the same for the music too, they used a lot of child-like, cheerful sounding music in this show ironically. Because they’re all playing kids game that was meant to be fun and simple with their lives. 

And I’m not sure whether this has any symbolisms, but I’m pretty sure the main room(the one with a lot of stairs) that they use to travel through their room to the game rooms are inspired by M.C Escher’s Relativity and many other similar artworks.
