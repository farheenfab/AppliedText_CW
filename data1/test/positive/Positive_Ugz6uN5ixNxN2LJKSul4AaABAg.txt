it felt like the show hinted pretty strongly that the VIP's are meant to be mirroring us, the viewers of this amazing series. the cringy acting, the questions they ask trying to figure out the games, the way they show the faces of the masked men in sequence as the game is progressing etc. i mean we all watched in horror as the characters are going through this hell but at the same time lets be honest, we all enjoyed it as well as the VIPs
