I watched the two seasons of aib and i thought squid game much better, especially because in AIB the deaths are ridiculous(people got shot multiple times or got stabbed and they kept alive for EPISODES and there  is an uncessary s3x scene in the second episode). Squid Game is actually the underrated show here, because it became so popular and so popular that people who didn't want to accept the hype tried to follow other show and started to discart the values from a guy who kept writing Squid Game for 8 years just to be hated because of his form to tell the story.
