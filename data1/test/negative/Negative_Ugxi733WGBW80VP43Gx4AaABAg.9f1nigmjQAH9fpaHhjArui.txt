It is a very disturbing show, indeed. However there's clearly an undertone message of how people's lives do matter in spite of the carnage. I interpret the show as an allegory to capitalism and it's an exaggeration of how people act in their everyday lives. It's just so that normally we're not in a life-or-death situation like in the movie, but if we were, don't think that most of us wouldn't do the things shown in the series.
