 it was the opposite for me. When people were talking about it I thought it was just overhype and actual show would just be a repeat of similar death game tropes that came before.HOLY SHIT was I wrong. The execution, the acting, and the music everything just blew me away. This is truly a show on an entirely different level than what were used to seeing in television in america at least.
