Thank you for this. The hype makes many people want to watch this, and it is a really good show. It can't be helped if it's got this realistic violence. But sometimes, people can't handle blood or gore for different reasons. 
It'd be nice if people respected that and didn't put others down for their discomfort. You don't know why they don't like blood, maybe they associate it with something traumatic, or it makes them ill. Be a bit more compassionate, people.
