One thing about this show is about how the "game" was interpreted. Uniformed soldiers, the rules, colorful settings, the childhood game, and realistic. For them, it's only a game, nothing more, because it's the players' perspective that makes it a survival game. Also, none of the soldiers said kill, the players were simply eliminated.
