However we try to put a spin on it, it's a fact that in India people who don't know how to speak in English are discriminated against. Language is just a medium of communication, and not a mark of someone's intelligence or class. It's a very classist and elitist concept in India.
It's ridiculous that these celebs act as if they and their kids are not well versed in Hindi. Their kids will join the Hindi film industry all because of nepotism.

People who don't know English are looked down upon in India and considered to be inferior. Which is just not right.

 Every state is bilingual and you'll find the use of the regional language more than English. All the government forms and official documents are available in the regional language too.
English definitely helps us in communicating across a country that has so much diversity.
But the classist and elitist attitude is just wrong.
