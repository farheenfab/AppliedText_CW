In a sense it’s supposed to be like it’s unfair for the others since the games aren’t supposed to be one sided. For example what if they gave a game that involved math for that math professor guy, then that would be unfair for the rest of the players. The game wasn’t about skill it was about luck. What’s so skillful about jumping on a glass that’s either tempered or not. It’s unfair if you have an experience with it that others don’t. Like for example if there was a race but there was a guy who was an Olympic racer, Don’t you think that’s unfair to the others? The games are supposed to be equal in chance without outside factors
