I personally thought him begging to the cameras to stop the fighting during murder night was the most solid clue. My brain definitely went "why the fuck did they listen to him?!" before just assuming they did because Front Man realised 001 was correct that they would have to stop the violence eventually or everyone but one would end up dying.
