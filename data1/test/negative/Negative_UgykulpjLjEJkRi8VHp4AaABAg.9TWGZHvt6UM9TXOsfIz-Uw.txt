nah bc he knew the 5th game was gonna be the hopscotch/floor is lava hybrid which he wouldnt be able to cheat/avoid his death in. I think one way or another he always intended on the 4th game being his last (either by losing or not being picked and thus being the odd man out and presumed killed by the rest of the players) 

1) Redlight/greenlight (as long as he wasnt blatantly moving off time no one would notice him not getting shot for moving)
2) HoneyComb (all the winners left before the execution of the losers thus they wouldnt know if he won/lost/didnt get executed for losing)
3) Tug of war (his locks werent actually locked to the rope so he wouldnt have gone over)
4) the marble game obv there was the fake execution off screen
