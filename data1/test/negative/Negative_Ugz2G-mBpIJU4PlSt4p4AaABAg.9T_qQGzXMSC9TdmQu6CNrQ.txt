He cheated in round 1.  he could cheat his way out of round 2.  Round 3 was really difficult to pull off.  Far too many variables in play.  Round 4 was hit or miss.  After round 4 ... no way he was going to make it through round 5.  And the explosions of the glass afterwards all but insured some level of harm.  

But as I look at the video with them laying on the ground after their win, I noticed two things.  One, there is no obvious lock on his shackles.  You see the loop for the lock to be, but you don't see the locks.  Two, his straps are loose enough he could pull both his hands out.  I think both were considered fail safes if his team was going to lose.  He is also near the back of the line so that the other players wouldn't notice his different treatment. 

But the story took some extreme liberties in the tug of war.  The old man was on his death bed.  He could barely walk.  Pulling in tug of war would probably have given him a heart attack.  The girls on the team, they simply weren't strong enough to compensate.  In brute force, it was more like 6 vs 10.  And the old man's team should have lost.  Even knowing all the winning strategies.
